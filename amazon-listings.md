### Book Description (KDP HTML — ~3,900 chars)

<b>Short summers. Long winters. The Midwest grows more food than anywhere in America — and your backyard can too.</b>

Midwestern gardeners face a unique paradox: some of the richest soil on Earth paired with some of the shortest growing seasons.

<b>Midwest Vegetable Gardening</b> is your state-by-state, zone-by-zone companion for 10 Heartland states:

• <b>Pest and disease guide</b> for Midwest-specific problems: tomato hornworms, squash vine borers, late blight, and four-legged raiders
• <b>Container and small-space gardening</b> for urban gardeners in Chicago, Minneapolis, Columbus, and beyond

You don't need a long summer to grow incredible food. You need the right plan for YOUR summer. This is that plan.

### Book Description (KDP HTML — ~3,900 chars)

<b>Nine months of rain. Cool summers. And one of the best vegetable gardening climates in the world — if you know how to use it.</b>

The Pacific Northwest confounds gardeners who learned the rules somewhere else. Tomatoes struggle in August fog while kale thrives through December rain.

• <b>Month-by-month planting calendars</b> for Western Washington, Western Oregon, Willamette Valley, and East-of-Cascades regions
• <b>50+ vegetable profiles</b> with PNW-proven varieties chosen for cool summers and short heat windows
• <b>Year-round growing strategies</b> — the PNW cool season is a second growing season, not a shutdown
• <b>Rain and moisture management</b> — raised beds, drainage solutions, and slug/mildew prevention
• <b>Warm-season success tactics</b> — heat-loving crops CAN thrive with the right varieties, timing, and microclimate tricks
• <b>Organic and sustainable methods</b> — cover cropping, composting, and integrated pest management aligned with PNW values
• <b>Container and small-space solutions</b> for Portland, Seattle, and urban gardeners

Stop fighting the climate. Start working with it.

<b>Part of the Harvest Home Guides series</b> — regional vegetable gardening guides built for where you actually live.

**Subtitle:** Month-by-Month Planting Calendar for Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and West Texas — Zones 5–10, Desert-Adapted Growing, and Water-Wise Techniques

### Book Description (KDP HTML — ~3,900 chars)

<b>The desert isn't barren — it's one of the most productive vegetable gardening environments in America, if you know the rules.</b>

Two growing seasons. Three hundred days of sunshine. Ancient irrigation wisdom meets modern water-wise techniques. Southwest gardening is nothing like what the mainstream books describe — because those books weren't written for 110°F afternoons, alkaline caliche soil, and 8 inches of annual rainfall.

<b>Southwest Vegetable Gardening</b> is your complete guide to desert and arid-region abundance:

• <b>Month-by-month planting calendars</b> for Low Desert (Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas), High Desert (Albuquerque, Santa Fe), and Intermountain (Salt Lake, El Paso) regions
• <b>50+ vegetable profiles</b> with heat-tolerant, drought-adapted variety recommendations
• <b>Two growing seasons maximized</b> — the cool fall-winter-spring season AND the monsoon summer season
• <b>Water-wise irrigation</b> — drip systems, ollas, mulching, and greywater strategies that grow more with dramatically less water
• <b>Alkaline soil and caliche solutions</b> — amendments, raised beds, and container strategies for the Southwest's challenging soils
• <b>Shade cloth and microclimate management</b> — protect crops from extreme heat while maximizing sunshine
• <b>Monsoon season strategies</b> — harness summer rains and manage flash flooding in the garden

The Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Mojave regions have fed people for thousands of years. This book brings that tradition into your modern backyard.

<b>Part of the Harvest Home Guides series</b> — regional vegetable gardening guides built for where you actually live.

### Book Description (KDP HTML — ~3,900 chars)

<b>Northern California is a vegetable gardening paradise — but only if you stop following advice written for the rest of the country.</b>

Your frost dates, rainfall patterns, and growing seasons have almost nothing in common with the Midwest book that dominates the gardening shelf.

<b>Northern California Vegetable Gardening</b> covers every growing zone from the foggy coast to the Sacramento Valley floor to the Sierra foothills:

• <b>Month-by-month planting calendars</b> for Bay Area/Coast, Sacramento Valley, Wine Country/North Bay, Sierra Foothills, and North Coast sub-regions
• <b>50+ vegetable profiles</b> with NorCal-proven varieties and microclimate recommendations
• <b>Mediterranean growing rhythm</b> — work WITH the dry-summer/wet-winter cycle instead of fighting it
• <b>Water-smart irrigation</b> — drip systems, mulching, and efficient watering for drought-conscious gardens
• <b>Fog-belt gardening</b> — warm-season crops in cool coastal microclimates
• <b>Fire season preparation</b> — defensible space, smoke impact on crops, and recovery strategies
• <b>Organic and sustainable practices</b> — cover cropping, composting, and no-spray pest management

From a San Francisco community garden plot to a Redding homestead, this book meets you where you grow.

<b>Part of the Harvest Home Guides series</b> — regional vegetable gardening guides built for where you actually live.

<b>Gardening at altitude changes everything — and finally, there's a book that gets it.</b>

### Book Description (KDP HTML — ~3,900 chars)

<b>Wide open sky. Relentless wind. And soil that built a nation. Welcome to Great Plains gardening.</b>

The prairie is defined by extremes: blistering summers, brutal winters, wind that never quits, and hailstorms that arrive without warning. But beneath that challenge lies some of the deepest, most fertile topsoil in the world — and gardeners who know how to work with this landscape grow extraordinary food.

<b>Great Plains Vegetable Gardening</b> is your prairie-specific companion:

• <b>Month-by-month planting calendars</b> for Northern Plains (Dakotas, NE), Central Plains (KS, OK panhandle), and Southern Plains (OK, north TX panhandle) sub-regions
• <b>50+ vegetable profiles</b> with wind-tolerant, drought-adapted, and temperature-extreme variety recommendations
• <b>Wind management strategies</b> — windbreaks, shelterbelts, and garden placement that turn the prairie's biggest challenge into a manageable factor
• <b>Drought-smart irrigation</b> — drip systems, mulching, rainwater harvesting, and efficient watering for limited-rainfall regions
• <b>Extreme temperature strategies</b> — 100°F summers and -30°F winters demand season extension, crop selection, and timing precision
• <b>Prairie soil optimization</b> — deep topsoil management, sod-breaking for new gardens, and organic matter maintenance
• <b>Hail and severe weather protection</b> — row covers, crop insurance thinking, and succession planting as storm recovery

From a Wichita backyard to a Nebraska homestead to a small-town Dakota garden, this book understands your climate, your soil, and your challenges.

## Series-Wide A+ Content Notes

**Consistent across all 10 books:**
- Use the same "From the Author" module template featuring Evan Maxon and EPM Labs, LLC
- Include a series cross-sell module on every book showing all 10 covers with "Find Your Region" header
- Maintain consistent visual branding: same font, color palette, and layout structure
- Each book's hero banner should use region-appropriate photography with consistent text overlay style
- Consider a shared "Why Regional Guides?" module explaining the Harvest Home Guides philosophy: national books don't work because gardening is local
