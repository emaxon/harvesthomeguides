# Part I: Getting Started in the Southeast

# Chapter 1: Why the Southeast Is Different

You picked up this book because you want to grow vegetables in the Southeast. Maybe you just moved to Charlotte from Chicago and you're thrilled about the longer growing season. Maybe you've gardened in coastal Georgia your whole life and last year's tomato blight finally broke you. Or maybe you're staring at a patch of red clay in Alabama and wondering if anything besides kudzu can grow in it.

Here's the truth about gardening in the Southeast: you have more growing potential than almost anywhere in the country. You also have more things actively trying to destroy your garden than almost anywhere in the country. Heat, humidity, fungal diseases, fire ants, Japanese beetles, armyworms, nematodes — the list reads like a horror novel. But gardeners across these eight states have been growing spectacular food for centuries, and with the right knowledge, you will too.

This book covers eight states: Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. That's a lot of ground — from the cool mountain hollows of western North Carolina to the subtropical swamps of southern Louisiana. But these states share a common gardening identity: long summers, high humidity, distinct two-season planting windows, and a rich tradition of Southern food crops that you simply can't find in generic national gardening books.

## Two Sub-Regions, One Philosophy

Throughout this book, we divide the Southeast into two sub-regions. Find yours and remember it — every planting date, variety recommendation, and task calendar in this book is keyed to these.

### Upper Southeast (USDA Zones 6b–7b)

**States:** North Carolina (mountain and piedmont), Tennessee, Arkansas (northern half)

**Last spring frost:** April 1–20  
**First fall frost:** October 15–November 5  
**Growing season:** 175–210 days

The Upper Southeast gets real winters. Not Minnesota winters, but enough to kill subtropical plants, freeze unprotected pipes, and give you a genuine dormant season. Your spring starts 3–4 weeks later than the coast, and your fall arrives earlier. The upside? You get a proper chill period for fruit trees and garlic, your pest pressure drops dramatically in winter, and your cool-season crops perform brilliantly through a long, mild fall.

### Lower Southeast (USDA Zones 7b–9a)

**States:** Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, coastal North Carolina, southern Arkansas

**Last spring frost:** March 1–25  
**First fall frost:** November 5–December 1  
**Growing season:** 220–280 days

The Lower Southeast is where the magic — and the madness — happens. Your growing season is enormous. In southern Louisiana and coastal Georgia, you can harvest something from your garden every single month of the year. But you'll also deal with brutal summer heat that shuts down tomato production, humidity that breeds fungal diseases overnight, and pest pressure that never fully lets up. The key is working with the heat instead of fighting it.

## The Two-Season Advantage

If you've gardened in the Midwest or Northeast, you probably think of gardening as one season: spring planting, summer growing, fall harvest, done. The Southeast flips that model on its head. You have two primary planting seasons, and the fall garden is often more productive than the spring one.

**Spring season:** Plant cool-season crops in late winter, warm-season crops after last frost. Harvest through early summer.

**Fall season:** Plant warm-season crops in mid-summer for fall harvest. Start cool-season crops in late summer through fall. Harvest into winter and sometimes beyond.

The gap between — the brutal July and August heat — is when you plan, amend soil, start fall seedlings, and maybe grow nothing but okra, sweet potatoes, and Southern peas (the three crops that actually love Southeast summers).

## USDA Hardiness Zones: The 2024 Update

The USDA updated its Plant Hardiness Zone Map in 2024, and it matters for you. Roughly half of the Southeast shifted half a zone warmer compared to the previous 2012 map. If your grandmother gardened in zone 7b in Atlanta, you might now be gardening in zone 8a.

Here's the practical impact:

| State | Major Cities | Typical Zones |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Georgia | Atlanta 7b–8a, Savannah 8b–9a, Macon 8a–8b | 7b–9a |
| Alabama | Birmingham 7b–8a, Mobile 8b–9a, Huntsville 7a–7b | 7a–9a |
| Mississippi | Jackson 8a–8b, Biloxi 8b–9a, Tupelo 7b–8a | 7b–9a |
| Louisiana | New Orleans 9a, Baton Rouge 8b–9a, Shreveport 8a–8b | 8a–9a |
| South Carolina | Charleston 8b–9a, Columbia 8a, Greenville 7b–8a | 7b–9a |
| North Carolina | Charlotte 7b–8a, Raleigh 7b, Asheville 6b–7a | 6b–8b |
| Tennessee | Nashville 7a–7b, Memphis 7b–8a, Knoxville 7a | 6b–8a |
| Arkansas | Little Rock 7b–8a, Fayetteville 6b–7a, Pine Bluff 8a | 6b–8a |

Zone numbers tell you minimum winter temperatures, which matters for perennials and overwintering crops. But for vegetable gardeners, your frost dates and growing season length matter more than your zone number. A zone 8a garden in Atlanta (with 90% humidity) is a completely different animal than a zone 8a garden in Portland, Oregon. Climate is more than a number.

## What Makes Southeast Gardening Unique

**Humidity.** This is the defining feature of Southeast gardening. Average summer humidity runs 70–90%, and it creates a paradise for fungal diseases. Powdery mildew, downy mildew, early blight, late blight, anthracnose, fusarium, septoria leaf spot — you'll encounter most of these every single year. Disease-resistant varieties aren't optional here. They're survival.

**Heat.** Summer temperatures routinely hit 95°F+ with overnight lows staying above 75°F. This matters because many common vegetables — tomatoes, peppers, beans — drop their blossoms when nighttime temperatures exceed 75°F. Your window for these crops is narrower than you think.

**Soil diversity.** Within a single state, you might find red clay, sandy loam, river bottom silt, and rocky mountain soil. We cover all of these in Chapter 2.

**Pests that never quit.** The Southeast's mild winters mean pest populations carry over year to year. Fire ants, Japanese beetles, squash vine borers, tomato hornworms, and stink bugs are permanent residents, not seasonal visitors.

**The Southern food garden tradition.** Okra, field peas (black-eyed peas, crowder peas, zipper peas), collard greens, sweet potatoes, muscadine grapes, hot peppers — these crops aren't just adapted to the Southeast; they thrive in the heat and humidity that kill off northern favorites. This book celebrates that tradition.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting by calendar instead of soil temperature.** A warm February week doesn't mean spring has arrived. Use a soil thermometer.
- **Ignoring the fall garden.** Most new Southeast gardeners only plant in spring and miss the more productive fall season entirely.
- **Fighting the heat.** If your tomatoes stop producing in July, that's normal. Don't throw money at the problem — plant heat-lovers and wait for fall tomatoes.
- **Skipping disease prevention.** By the time you see fungal spots, you're already weeks behind. Prevention is everything in humid climates.
- **Using national gardening advice.** A book written for "zones 5–9" is too broad to help you. Southeast gardening has specific challenges that demand specific solutions.

# Chapter 2: Know Your Soil

The first time you push a shovel into Southeast soil, you'll know exactly which kind you have. If the shovel barely penetrates and the soil comes up in dense, sticky clumps that cling to everything — congratulations, you've got Piedmont clay. If the shovel slides in easily and the soil pours through your fingers like brown sugar — that's Coastal Plain sand. And if you're somewhere in between, with dark, crumbly soil that actually smells good, you've won the lottery.

Most of you haven't won the lottery. But every soil type in the Southeast can grow exceptional vegetables with the right amendments.

## Piedmont Clay

**Where you'll find it:** Atlanta metro, Charlotte, much of upstate South Carolina, central Alabama, parts of Tennessee

Piedmont clay is the most common — and most complained about — soil in the Southeast. It's dense, heavy, slow-draining, and turns into either concrete or soup depending on whether it's rained recently. The red color comes from iron oxide, and it's actually rich in minerals. The problem isn't nutrition — it's structure.

Clay particles are microscopically flat, like tiny playing cards stacked together. Water can't move through, roots can't penetrate, and air pockets don't form. When it's wet, it compacts easily (never work wet clay — you'll create bricks). When it's dry, it cracks and shrinks away from foundations and plant roots.

**The fix:** You're not going to "fix" clay in one season. This is a multi-year project. Here's the plan:

1. **Organic matter, organic matter, organic matter.** Add 3–4 inches of compost to the top of your beds every season. Work it into the top 6–8 inches. Over time, the organic matter breaks up clay structure, improves drainage, and feeds soil biology. This is the single most important thing you can do.

2. **Gypsum** (calcium sulfate) helps flocculate clay — it causes the tiny flat particles to clump together, creating air pockets. Apply 40 pounds per 1,000 square feet annually. It works slowly but it works. Unlike lime, gypsum doesn't change pH significantly.

3. **Coarse pine bark fines** (also called soil conditioner) are the Southeast's secret weapon for clay. Mix 2–3 inches into clay soil. The bark pieces physically separate clay particles and decompose slowly, feeding the soil for years. Available at every garden center in the Southeast.

4. **Don't add sand to clay.** This is the most persistent bad advice in Southern gardening. Sand + clay = something resembling concrete. The particle sizes are wrong. Just don't do it.

5. **Raised beds** are the shortcut. If you're gardening in heavy clay and want vegetables this year, build raised beds at least 12 inches deep and fill them with a mix of topsoil, compost, and pine bark fines (roughly 1/3 each). Your clay becomes the subfloor, not the growing medium.

**pH:** Piedmont clay typically runs 5.5–6.5 (slightly acidic). Most vegetables prefer 6.0–6.8. You may need lime, but test first.

## Coastal Plain Sand

**Where you'll find it:** Coastal Georgia, coastal South Carolina, coastal North Carolina, southern Mississippi, most of Louisiana, southern Alabama

Sandy soil is clay's opposite in almost every way. It drains fast — sometimes too fast. Nutrients wash through before plants can absorb them. It doesn't hold moisture. On the positive side, it's easy to work, warms up quickly in spring (giving you an earlier planting window), and roots move through it effortlessly.

**The fix:**

1. **Organic matter** — yes, same answer as clay, for different reasons. In sand, organic matter acts like a sponge, holding moisture and nutrients in the root zone. Add 3–4 inches of compost every season.

2. **Mulch heavily.** Sandy soil dries out fast. A 3–4 inch layer of straw, leaves, or pine straw dramatically reduces evaporation and moderates soil temperature.

3. **Fertilize more frequently, at lower rates.** Because nutrients leach through sandy soil quickly, you're better off applying fertilizer every 2–3 weeks at half-strength rather than one heavy application that washes away with the next rain.

4. **Consider drip irrigation.** Sandy soil and overhead sprinklers are a bad combination — most of the water drains below the root zone before plants can use it. Drip irrigation delivers water slowly right where roots need it.

**pH:** Coastal sand often runs 5.0–6.0 (more acidic than clay, especially in pine-forested areas). Lime is frequently needed.

## Mississippi River Bottomland

**Where you'll find it:** The Delta region of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas, northeastern Louisiana, western Tennessee (along the Mississippi)

This is the Southeast's best agricultural soil, and it's been growing crops commercially for two centuries. River alluvium — silt deposited by flooding over millennia — creates deep, fertile, well-structured soil that most gardeners would kill for.

If you garden in bottomland, your challenges are different: possible flooding, heavy texture that can stay wet too long, and sometimes soil compaction from heavy agricultural equipment use.

**The fix:** Bottomland needs less fixing and more managing. Raise your beds slightly (even 4–6 inches helps drainage). Add compost annually to maintain organic matter. Monitor for waterlogging during heavy rain events — this soil holds water well, sometimes too well.

**pH:** Usually 6.0–7.0, close to neutral. Often needs minimal adjustment.

## Mountain and Ridge Soils

**Where you'll find it:** Western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia mountains, the Ozarks in Arkansas

Mountain soils are thin, rocky, and acidic. Topsoil layers may be only a few inches deep before you hit rock or subsoil. These soils are often rich in organic matter (from leaf litter) but low in nutrients and very acidic (pH 4.5–5.5).

**The fix:** Raised beds are almost mandatory in mountain gardens. The native soil is too thin and rocky for serious vegetable production. Build beds at least 12 inches deep. Lime is usually needed to raise pH — sometimes substantial amounts. Get a soil test before adding anything.

## Get a Soil Test

Before you add a single amendment, get a soil test. Every state in the Southeast has a cooperative extension soil testing lab, and most charge between $0 and $15. This is the best money you'll ever spend on your garden.

| State | Extension Lab | Cost | Turnaround |
|-------|-------------|------|------------|
| Georgia | UGA Extension | Free (basic) | 1–2 weeks |
| Alabama | Auburn University | Free | 2–3 weeks |
| Mississippi | MSU Extension | Free | 1–2 weeks |
| Louisiana | LSU AgCenter | Free–$15 | 1–2 weeks |
| South Carolina | Clemson Extension | $6 | 2–3 weeks |
| North Carolina | NCDA&CS | Free | 2–4 weeks |
| Tennessee | UT Extension | Free | 2–3 weeks |
| Arkansas | U of A Extension | Free | 2–3 weeks |

A soil test tells you your pH, nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients), organic matter percentage, and specific amendment recommendations. This is not optional — it's step one.

**Pro Tip:** Test your soil every 2–3 years. Soil conditions change as you add amendments, and what you needed three years ago may not be what you need now. Fall is the best time to test, because lime and sulfur need months to work and you'll have time to apply them before spring planting.

## Building Your Beds

Whether you're amending in-ground soil or building raised beds, here's what Southeast gardeners need:

**In-ground amendment recipe (per 100 square feet):**
- 6–8 cubic feet of compost
- 3–4 cubic feet of pine bark fines (for clay soil)
- Lime or sulfur per soil test recommendations
- 2 lbs of a balanced organic fertilizer (like 4-4-4)

**Raised bed mix (per cubic yard):**
- 1/3 screened topsoil
- 1/3 compost
- 1/3 pine bark fines
- 5 lbs lime (adjust after soil test)
- 3 lbs balanced organic fertilizer

**Pro Tip:** In the Southeast, avoid using untreated wood for raised beds. Pine rots in 2–3 years in our humidity. Use cedar, cypress (sustainably sourced), composite lumber, or galvanized metal. Concrete blocks work great and last forever — just know they can leach lime and slightly raise soil pH near the edges.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not testing soil before amending.** You might be adding lime to soil that's already alkaline, or adding sulfur when your pH is fine. Test first.
- **Working clay when it's wet.** If clay sticks to your shovel, stop. Come back in two days. Working wet clay destroys its structure.
- **Expecting instant results.** Soil improvement is a multi-year project. Your soil will be noticeably better after one season, good after three, and excellent after five. Keep adding organic matter.
- **Tilling every season.** Excessive tilling destroys soil structure, kills beneficial organisms, and brings weed seeds to the surface. Once your beds are established, add compost on top and let worms and biology do the mixing.
- **Using potting soil in raised beds.** Potting soil is for containers. In raised beds, it compacts, dries out unevenly, and is wildly expensive at scale. Use a topsoil/compost/bark mix.

# Chapter 3: Water in the Southeast

Here's an irony that every Southeast gardener discovers: we get 40–65 inches of rainfall per year — more than almost anywhere else in the country — and you still need to water your garden. Sometimes desperately.

The Southeast's rain pattern is feast or famine. You'll get 4 inches in two days, then nothing for three weeks. July and August can deliver thunderstorms that dump an inch in twenty minutes, then bake your garden at 97°F for the next ten days while that moisture evaporates. Spring rain events can be so heavy and prolonged that gardens stay waterlogged for days, drowning roots and breeding disease.

The goal isn't just getting water to your plants. It's getting the right amount of water at the right time without creating the humid conditions that fungal diseases love. That's the Southeast watering puzzle.

## How Much Water Do Vegetables Need?

The standard answer is 1–1.5 inches per week, and it's a reasonable starting point. But in the Southeast summer, with temperatures above 90°F and sandy soil, you might need 2 inches. In spring, with cooler temperatures and clay soil, 1 inch might be too much.

**Measure, don't guess.** Buy a cheap rain gauge ($3 at any hardware store) and put it in your garden. Check it after every rain event. If nature delivered 0.7 inches this week, you need to provide the remaining 0.3–0.8 inches.

**Pro Tip:** Soil moisture meters ($10–15) take the guesswork out entirely. Push the probe into the root zone (4–6 inches deep) and check. If it reads "dry," water. If it reads "moist," don't. Simple.

## Drip Irrigation: The Southeast Standard

If you take one piece of infrastructure advice from this entire book, make it this: install drip irrigation. In the Southeast, drip irrigation isn't a luxury — it's a disease prevention system.

Here's why. Overhead watering (sprinklers, hose-end sprayers) wets the foliage. Wet foliage + heat + humidity = fungal spores germinating in hours. Early blight, powdery mildew, downy mildew, septoria leaf spot — all of these need wet leaves to infect. Drip irrigation keeps water at the soil level, where roots can use it and leaves stay dry.

**Basic drip setup for a vegetable garden:**

1. **Timer** — battery-operated, attaches to your hose bib. Set it and forget it. ($25–40)
2. **Pressure regulator** — reduces your house pressure (50–80 psi) to drip-appropriate pressure (15–25 psi). ($8)
3. **Filter** — prevents clogging. ($5–8)
4. **1/2-inch mainline tubing** — runs the length of your beds. ($0.15/foot)
5. **1/4-inch drip emitter tubing** — branches off the mainline, runs along each row. Use 1/2 GPH emitters spaced every 12 inches for most vegetables. ($0.10/foot)

Total cost for a 200-square-foot garden: approximately $60–80. You'll save that in reduced water bills and reduced fungicide applications within one season.

**Watering schedule (drip):**

| Season | Frequency | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Spring (Mar–May) | Every 2–3 days | 30–45 minutes |
| Summer (Jun–Aug) | Daily | 45–60 minutes |
| Fall (Sep–Nov) | Every 2–3 days | 30–45 minutes |
| Winter (Dec–Feb) | Weekly or as needed | 20–30 minutes |

Adjust based on rainfall, soil type (sand dries faster, clay retains longer), and plant size. These are starting points, not rules.

## Mulch: Your Second Irrigation System

Mulch reduces watering needs by 25–50%. In the Southeast, where summer evaporation is intense, a good mulch layer is the difference between watering daily and watering every 2–3 days.

**Best mulches for Southeast vegetable gardens:**

- **Straw** (not hay — hay has weed seeds). 3–4 inches thick. The classic choice. Decomposes in one season, feeding the soil. Inexpensive.
- **Pine straw** — readily available throughout the Southeast. Slightly acidifying, which is fine for most vegetables. Doesn't mat down or blow away easily. 3–4 inches.
- **Shredded leaves** — free if you have hardwood trees. Shred them with a mower first; whole leaves mat down and shed water. 2–3 inches.
- **Wood chips** — best for pathways, not directly around vegetable stems. Can temporarily tie up nitrogen as they decompose. Keep them 2–3 inches away from plant stems.

**Pro Tip:** In the Southeast, mulch serves triple duty: it conserves moisture, suppresses weeds, and keeps soil cooler in summer. Bare soil in July sun can reach 140°F+ at the surface. Under 3 inches of straw, it stays around 85°F. That temperature difference is the difference between living roots and dead ones.

## Rainwater Harvesting

The Southeast gets enough rain that a simple rainwater collection system can meaningfully supplement your irrigation. A 1,000-square-foot roof section generates about 600 gallons per inch of rain. Over a typical year, that's potentially 24,000–39,000 gallons.

You don't need all of it. A single 55-gallon rain barrel connected to a downspout will overflow regularly in the Southeast. Two or three barrels (or a 250-gallon IBC tote) give you a useful reserve for dry spells.

**Legal note:** Rain barrel legality varies. As of 2026, all eight Southeast states covered in this book allow residential rainwater collection. Some localities may have restrictions on container size or mosquito screening requirements. Check your county regulations.

**Mosquito management:** In the Southeast, any standing water becomes a mosquito breeding ground within days. Screen all barrel openings with fine mesh, use mosquito dunks (Bt israelensis — safe for plants and pets), and use collected water regularly so it doesn't stagnate.

## When Not to Water

Overwatering kills more Southeast vegetable gardens than underwatering. In clay soil especially, too much water fills air pockets, suffocates roots, and creates the anaerobic conditions that root rot fungi love.

Signs you're overwatering:
- Yellowing lower leaves (looks like nutrient deficiency but isn't)
- Wilting even though soil is wet (roots are drowning)
- Fungus gnats hovering around soil surface
- Moss or algae growing on soil surface
- Sour or sulfurous smell from soil

If your soil is consistently wet 24 hours after watering, you're applying too much or your drainage is poor. Fix the drainage (amend soil, raise beds) before adding more water.

## Common Mistakes

- **Watering on a fixed schedule regardless of rain.** If it rained 2 inches yesterday, turn off the timer for a few days.
- **Watering in the evening.** Wet foliage overnight in Southeast humidity is an invitation to every fungal disease known to science. Water in the early morning (before 10 AM) so leaves dry quickly.
- **Shallow, frequent watering.** This encourages shallow root systems that can't handle dry spells. Water deeply and less often to encourage roots to grow deep.
- **Ignoring mulch.** Bare soil in the Southeast summer is a losing proposition. Mulch everything.
- **Overhead watering tomatoes.** Just don't. Drip only for tomatoes, peppers, squash, and cucumbers in the Southeast. Your blight rate will drop dramatically.

# Chapter 4: Planning Your Southeast Garden

You could read this entire book cover to cover before planting a single seed. Or you could start with ten crops that practically grow themselves in the Southeast, build some confidence, and learn the details as you go. This chapter gives you both paths.

## The First Garden: 10 Easy Wins

If you're a first-time gardener — or a first-time Southeast gardener — start with these. They're heat-tolerant, disease-resistant, and forgiving of beginner mistakes.

1. **Cherry tomatoes** — Specifically 'Sun Gold' or 'Sweet 100'. They produce fruit even when full-size tomatoes are sulking in the heat.
2. **Okra** — The ultimate Southeast crop. Loves heat, laughs at humidity, produces until frost. 'Clemson Spineless' is the standard.
3. **Sweet potatoes** — Plant slips in May, ignore them until October, dig up dinner. Easiest crop in the Southeast.
4. **Southern peas** (field peas) — 'Mississippi Silver', 'Pinkeye Purple Hull', or 'California Blackeye'. Heat-loving, nitrogen-fixing, and they freeze beautifully.
5. **Collards** — The tougher, more heat-tolerant cousin of kale. 'Georgia Southern' or 'Vates'. Can take light frost and summer heat alike.
6. **Zucchini** — Grows fast, produces heavily. Plant two plants, feed the neighborhood. Just watch for squash vine borers (Chapter 21).
7. **Bush beans** — 'Contender' or 'Provider'. Plant in spring and again in fall. 50 days from seed to harvest.
8. **Cucumbers** — 'Marketmore 76' or 'Straight Eight'. Trellis them for better air circulation and less disease.
9. **Peppers** — Start with easy bell peppers ('Big Bertha') or jalapeños ('Early Jalapeño'). They love Southeast summers.
10. **Lettuce** (fall/winter) — 'Black Seeded Simpson' or 'Buttercrunch'. Plant in September–October for your first cool-season success.

## Site Selection

Before you buy a single seed, evaluate your planting site:

**Sun:** Vegetables need 6–8 hours of direct sunlight. Period. Leafy greens can manage with 4–6, but fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers, squash) need full sun. In the Southeast, a site with morning sun and afternoon shade can actually outperform full-sun sites in summer, because the afternoon shade reduces heat stress.

**Drainage:** Your garden should never have standing water more than an hour after a hard rain. If it does, you need raised beds, or you need a different spot.

**Air circulation:** This is more important in the Southeast than in drier climates. Good air flow dries foliage faster and reduces disease pressure. Avoid planting against walls, fences, or dense hedges that block airflow. Leave generous spacing between rows.

**Proximity to water:** Your garden needs to be close enough to a water source that you'll actually water it. A garden 200 feet from the nearest hose bib is a garden that dies in July.

**Tree roots:** That beautiful old oak provides lovely afternoon shade, but its roots extend well beyond its canopy (called the drip line). Tree roots will outcompete vegetable roots for water and nutrients every time. Keep vegetable beds at least 10 feet from large trees.

## Garden Layout and Sizing

**For beginners:** Start with 100–200 square feet. That's a 10×10 or 10×20 space, or four 4×8 raised beds. This is enough to grow meaningful quantities of 8–12 crops without overwhelming you.

**For experienced gardeners:** 400–800 square feet gives you room for serious production, succession planting, crop rotation, and dedicated space for large crops like sweet potatoes and corn.

**Row spacing in the Southeast:** Space rows wider than national guidelines suggest. The standard 18-inch row spacing works fine in Colorado's dry air. In the Southeast's humidity, give plants more room for air circulation. Use 24–36 inch rows for most crops, wider for sprawling plants like squash and melons.

**Orientation:** Run rows north to south so both sides of the row get equal sun exposure throughout the day. Place tall crops (corn, trellised beans, tomato cages) on the north side of the garden so they don't shade shorter crops.

## Succession Planting

Succession planting means staggering your plantings so you harvest over a longer period instead of getting everything at once. It's the difference between drowning in 40 pounds of beans in one week and harvesting 5 pounds a week for two months.

**How to do it:** Instead of planting all your bush beans on March 15, plant one-third on March 15, one-third on April 1, and one-third on April 15. Apply this approach to any quick-maturing crop: lettuce, radishes, beans, cucumbers, summer squash.

**Southeast-specific succession:** In the Southeast, you can take succession planting further because of the long season. Plant spring beans in March–April, then plant again in August for fall harvest. Spring lettuce from February–March, fall lettuce from September–November. This is the two-season advantage in action.

## Seed Starting vs. Direct Sowing

Some crops must be started indoors and transplanted; others resent transplanting and must be direct-sown. Here's the breakdown for the Southeast:

**Start indoors (transplant):**
- Tomatoes (6–8 weeks before transplant date)
- Peppers (8–10 weeks before transplant date)
- Eggplant (6–8 weeks before transplant date)
- Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (6–8 weeks before transplant date)
- Collards, kale (4–6 weeks before transplant date)

**Direct sow:**
- Beans (all types)
- Corn
- Cucumbers
- Squash (summer and winter)
- Okra
- Southern peas
- Root vegetables (carrots, beets, radishes, turnips)
- Lettuce and greens

**Either way:**
- Melons (direct sow in Lower SE, start indoors in Upper SE)
- Sweet potatoes (from slips, not seeds — purchased or grown)

**Pro Tip:** In the Southeast, starting seeds indoors requires managing humidity. Damping-off disease — a fungal condition that kills seedlings at the soil line — is a real risk. Use sterile seed-starting mix, provide good air circulation (a small fan on low), and don't overwater. Bottom watering helps.

## Record Keeping

Keep a garden journal. Seriously. Write down what you planted, when, what variety, when it germinated, when you harvested, what diseases showed up, and what the weather was like. After two or three years, you'll have an invaluable reference that's far more useful than any book — because it's specific to your exact location, soil, and conditions.

A simple spiral notebook works fine. So does a spreadsheet, a note-taking app, or a dedicated garden journal. The format doesn't matter; the habit does.

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting too big.** A 1,000-square-foot garden sounds exciting in February and feels like forced labor in July. Start small, expand when you're ready.
- **Ignoring fall planting.** Mark August and September in your calendar NOW. That's when you need to start fall crops, and it sneaks up on everyone.
- **Planting too close together.** I know the seed packet says 12 inches apart. In the Southeast, give it 18. Air circulation prevents disease.
- **Not planning for height.** Tall crops on the south side of the garden = shaded everything else.
- **Buying seeds from the wrong source.** Seeds bred for the Southeast outperform generic varieties. Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, Sow True Seed, and local farm supply stores carry varieties adapted to our conditions.

# Part II: Month-by-Month Guide

# Chapter 5: January — Planning and Preparation

January in the Southeast ranges from genuinely cold (teens and twenties in the Upper Southeast) to mild enough to garden on warm afternoons (Lower Southeast). Either way, this is planning month. The decisions you make now — what to grow, what to order, what to build — determine how your spring garden performs.

## What to Do This Month

**All regions:**
- Order seeds. Now. Popular varieties sell out by February. Priority seed companies for the Southeast: Southern Exposure Seed Exchange (Virginia), Sow True Seed (Asheville, NC), Baker Creek, Johnny's Selected Seeds, Territorial Seed Company.
- Review last year's garden notes. What worked? What failed? Do more of the former and less of the latter.
- Get a soil test if you haven't in 2+ years. You can still apply lime or sulfur this month and have it take effect by spring.
- Build or repair raised beds, trellises, and fencing.
- Clean, sharpen, and oil tools. Replace anything that's rusted beyond saving.
- Inventory supplies: seed starting trays, potting mix, fertilizer, row cover fabric.

**Lower Southeast (zones 8a–9a):**
- Start onion seeds indoors (or order transplants for February planting).
- Plant bare-root fruit trees and berry bushes while dormant.
- On warm days (50°F+), direct sow snap peas, spinach, lettuce, and radishes under row covers.
- Harvest overwintered greens (collards, kale, spinach) that were planted last fall.
- Start broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage seeds indoors for February–March transplanting.

**Upper Southeast (zones 6b–7b):**
- Start planning only — no outdoor planting. Ground is likely frozen or saturated.
- Begin indoor seed starting for cool-season crops in late January (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage).
- Spread compost and amendments on frozen or dormant beds — they'll work in as the ground thaws.
- Check stored harvests (sweet potatoes, winter squash, dried beans) for spoilage.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Overwintering pests:** Clean up any crop debris left from fall. Squash vine borer pupae overwinter in the soil; cucumber beetle adults hide in leaf litter. Removing debris now reduces spring populations.
- **Rodents:** Voles and mice are active in mulched beds during winter. Check for tunneling near stored root crops.

## Pro Tips

- **The seed starting calendar works backward from your last frost date.** If your last frost is March 15 (Lower SE), and tomatoes need 6–8 weeks indoors, start tomato seeds January 15–February 1. Write your specific dates on a calendar now.
- **Don't start warm-season seeds too early.** Leggy, root-bound seedlings that sit under lights for 12 weeks perform worse than stocky seedlings started on time. Patience.

# Chapter 6: February — The Season Begins

February is when the Southeast garden wakes up. In the Lower Southeast, it's full-on spring planting season for cool-season crops. In the Upper Southeast, you're watching the weather and prepping for a March start. Either way, the garden is happening.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Direct sow outdoors:** Peas (snap, snow, English), lettuce, spinach, radishes, carrots, beets, Swiss chard, turnips, kale, collards, mustard greens, onion sets.
- **Transplant outdoors:** Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, onion transplants (if soil is workable).
- **Start indoors:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant (if you haven't already — you need these started 6–10 weeks before last frost).

**Upper Southeast:**
- **Start indoors:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant (6–10 weeks before April last frost). Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage.
- **Direct sow outdoors (late February, weather permitting):** Peas, spinach, lettuce under row cover.
- **Not yet:** Don't rush warm-season crops outdoors. A late freeze will kill them dead.

## What to Harvest

- Overwintered collards, kale, spinach, turnip greens (Lower SE)
- Late-planted fall lettuce still producing (Lower SE)
- Green onions from fall plantings

## Key Tasks

- Apply pre-emergent weed control to garden paths (corn gluten meal for organic gardens).
- Top-dress beds with 1–2 inches of compost.
- Install or check drip irrigation systems before the busy season.
- Prune dormant grape vines, berry bushes, and fruit trees (before bud break).
- Turn compost piles — they're starting to heat up as temperatures rise.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Aphids** appear on cool-season crops as soon as it warms up. Check the undersides of broccoli and kale leaves. A strong blast of water knocks them off. Ladybugs eat them by the hundreds.
- **Flea beetles** attack young brassica seedlings. Row cover is the best prevention.
- **Slugs** love cool, wet February nights. Set out beer traps or scatter iron phosphate bait (Sluggo).

## Pro Tips

- **Hardening off matters.** Seedlings started indoors need 7–10 days of gradually increasing outdoor exposure before transplanting. Start with 2 hours of shade, increase daily, and don't skip this step. Transplant shock in the Southeast's variable February weather kills more seedlings than frost.
- **Don't rototill wet soil.** If you can squeeze a handful of soil and water drips out, it's too wet to work. Wait.

# Chapter 7: March — Spring Planting Ramps Up

March is the most exciting month in the Southeast garden. Dogwoods and azaleas are blooming, soil temperatures are climbing, and the last frost date is approaching (or has already passed in the Lower Southeast). This is when the spring garden really takes shape.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast (last frost March 1–25):**
- **After last frost, direct sow:** Bush beans, sweet corn, cucumbers, summer squash, zucchini, okra (wait until soil is 65°F+), Southern peas.
- **Transplant outdoors:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant (after last frost and when nighttime temps stay above 50°F). Herbs: basil, rosemary, thyme.
- **Continue sowing:** Lettuce (switch to heat-tolerant varieties), carrots, beets.
- **Plant:** Seed potatoes (Irish potatoes — plant by St. Patrick's Day in the Lower SE, a tradition with practical timing behind it).

**Upper Southeast (last frost April 1–20):**
- **Direct sow outdoors:** Peas, lettuce, spinach, radishes, carrots, beets, Swiss chard, turnips, kale, collards. Plant potatoes mid-March.
- **Transplant outdoors:** Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (these can handle light frost).
- **Start indoors:** Continue tomato, pepper, eggplant seedlings if not started in February.
- **Hold warm-season crops.** Don't plant tomatoes, peppers, squash, or beans outdoors yet in the Upper Southeast. One late frost will undo weeks of work.

## What to Harvest

- Peas (snap and snow peas from February plantings, Lower SE)
- Lettuce, spinach, radishes, turnip greens
- Broccoli (from fall/winter plantings in Lower SE)
- Asparagus begins producing this month

## Key Tasks

- Set up tomato cages and stakes BEFORE planting. It's much harder to cage a 3-foot tomato without damaging roots.
- Install shade cloth infrastructure. You won't need it yet, but you'll need it in May–June when temperatures spike. Having the frame ready saves scrambling later.
- Thin direct-sown seedlings ruthlessly. This is hard emotionally and essential practically. Crowded carrots produce nothing useful. Crowded lettuce gets disease.
- Begin weekly fertilization schedule for heavy feeders (tomatoes, peppers, corn).
- Put out cucumber beetle traps or use row cover on cucurbit seedlings until they begin flowering.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Cutworms** — Wrap a small collar of cardboard or aluminum foil around transplant stems at soil level. Cutworms chew through stems at ground level at night.
- **Cabbage loopers and imported cabbageworms** — White butterflies fluttering around your broccoli = eggs on the leaves = green caterpillars eating everything. Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) spray is organic and effective.
- **Fire ants** — Mound activity increases as soil warms. Treat mounds in and around the garden with spinosad-based bait.

## Pro Tips

- **The 50°F soil temperature rule.** Most warm-season seeds rot in cold soil. Don't plant tomatoes, peppers, beans, squash, cucumbers, corn, or okra until your soil thermometer (at 4-inch depth) consistently reads 50°F for beans, 60°F for tomatoes and peppers, and 65°F for okra and melons. Air temperature lies. Soil temperature tells the truth.
- **Succession-plant beans and lettuce.** Plant a new row every 2 weeks through the end of April for continuous harvest.

# Chapter 8: April — The Garden in Full Swing

April is peak spring planting across the entire Southeast. The Upper Southeast is finally past frost risk, and the Lower Southeast is in full production. This is the month when the garden goes from a few rows of cool-season crops to a full-fledged vegetable operation.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Direct sow:** Okra (soil must be 65°F+), Southern peas, lima beans, watermelon, cantaloupe, sweet corn (second succession), cucumbers, summer squash.
- **Transplant:** Any remaining tomatoes, peppers, eggplant. This is your last good window — plants transplanted after early May in the Lower Southeast face brutal heat before they're established.
- **Plant sweet potato slips** late April (order or purchase now — slips ship when weather warms).

**Upper Southeast:**
- **After last frost (mid-April), direct sow:** Bush beans, sweet corn, cucumbers, summer squash, zucchini.
- **Transplant outdoors:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant (after April 15 in most areas). Protect with row cover if late frost threatens.
- **Continue sowing cool-season crops:** There's still time for one more round of lettuce, radishes, and peas if you use heat-tolerant varieties.
- **Plant potatoes** if not done in March.

## What to Harvest

- Lettuce, spinach, radishes, turnip greens (harvesting accelerates — these bolt as it warms)
- Peas (snap and shell peas peak this month)
- Broccoli side shoots (main heads usually harvested by now)
- Strawberries (peak harvest across the Southeast)
- Asparagus (peak harvest)
- Potatoes (early varieties in Lower SE)

## Key Tasks

- **Mulch everything.** As soil warms, apply 3–4 inches of straw or pine straw around all plants. This is your last easy chance before the garden fills in.
- Begin weekly scouting for pests. Walk the garden every morning with coffee. Flip leaves, check stems, look at the soil. Five minutes of scouting prevents five hours of damage control.
- Side-dress tomatoes and peppers with balanced fertilizer (or compost) when first flowers appear.
- Prune tomato suckers if growing indeterminate varieties. Remove suckers below the first flower cluster for better air circulation.
- Start collecting and freezing extra peas and lettuce before the heat takes them.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Squash vine borers.** The adults (wasp-like moths) emerge in April in the Lower Southeast. Wrap the base of squash and zucchini stems with aluminum foil or nylon stocking material to prevent egg-laying. This is your best prevention window.
- **Tomato hornworms** — The big green caterpillars appear now. Hand-pick daily. If you see one with white rice-like projections on its back, leave it — those are parasitic wasp cocoons that will kill the hornworm and produce more beneficial wasps.
- **Early blight** appears on tomatoes as soon as humidity rises. Lower leaves develop brown spots with concentric rings. Remove affected leaves immediately. Preventative copper or chlorothalonil spray helps.

## Pro Tips

- **Remove spring cool-season crops as they bolt.** Lettuce, spinach, and peas will bolt (go to seed) as temperatures hit 80°F+. Don't let them take up space and harbor pests. Pull them, compost them, and plant warm-season crops in their place.
- **April is your tomato health window.** The decisions you make this month — staking, mulching, pruning, preventative spraying — determine whether your tomatoes produce into July or collapse by June.

# Chapter 9: May — The Heat Arrives

May in the Southeast feels like a switch flips. The pleasant spring gardening weather gives way to genuine heat — 85°F to 95°F days, rising humidity, and afternoon thunderstorms that can drop 2 inches in an hour. Cool-season crops are done. Warm-season crops are taking over. And the pest and disease pressure ramps up dramatically.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Plant sweet potato slips** (early May is ideal for most of the Lower SE).
- **Direct sow:** Okra (final succession), Southern peas, lima beans, watermelon (last chance).
- **Don't plant new tomatoes or peppers** — it's too late for spring crops to establish before summer heat. Wait for the fall planting window.

**Upper Southeast:**
- **Direct sow:** Okra, Southern peas, lima beans, watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumbers (final succession), sweet corn, bush beans.
- **Plant sweet potato slips** mid to late May.
- **Transplant:** Late tomato and pepper transplants still have a window through mid-May.

## What to Harvest

- **Tomatoes** — Early varieties start ripening in the Lower Southeast. Check daily; fruits crack if left too long in heat and rain.
- **Squash and zucchini** — Harvest every 1–2 days. Oversized zucchini happen fast.
- **Bush beans** — First spring planting is ready.
- **Cucumbers** — Pick at 6–8 inches for best flavor.
- **Potatoes** — When plants begin to die back, potatoes are ready.
- **Onions** — When tops fall over naturally.
- **Last of the cool-season crops** — Anything still standing is about to bolt or already has.

## Key Tasks

- **Increase watering.** Switch drip irrigation to daily or near-daily as temperatures rise.
- **Refresh mulch** if it's thinned or decomposed. Maintain 3–4 inches.
- **Side-dress heavy feeders** (tomatoes, corn, peppers, squash) with fertilizer or compost.
- **Start planning the fall garden.** Yes, already. You need to order fall seeds and plan your August planting schedule now. Warm-season fall crops (tomatoes, peppers) need to be started indoors by mid-June.
- **Harvest regularly.** Most vegetables produce more when harvested frequently. Letting squash, beans, and cucumbers get oversized signals the plant to slow down production.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Squash vine borers** are in full attack mode. Check the base of squash stems for frass (sawdust-like material). If you find it, slit the stem lengthwise with a razor blade, remove the borer, and mound soil over the wound.
- **Tomato diseases** escalate rapidly. Early blight, septoria leaf spot, and bacterial speck all thrive in warm, humid conditions. Remove affected leaves, maintain airflow, and apply fungicide preventatively.
- **Japanese beetles** emerge in late May in the Lower Southeast. They skeletonize bean, grape, and rose leaves. Hand-pick into soapy water or use milky spore disease as a long-term grub control.
- **Stink bugs** (brown marmorated and Southern green) start feeding on tomatoes and peppers. The damage shows as hard, white spots inside the fruit.

## Pro Tips

- **Pick tomatoes at "breaker" stage** (when they first show color change from green to pink) and ripen indoors. This prevents cracking from rain, reduces bird and insect damage, and doesn't affect flavor — tomatoes ripen fine on the counter.
- **Don't be alarmed if tomatoes stop setting fruit in late May.** When nighttime temperatures stay above 75°F, tomato pollen becomes nonviable. The plants will flower but not fruit. This is normal. They'll resume setting fruit when temperatures drop in September.

# Chapter 10: June — Managing the Heat

June is when Southeast gardening becomes an endurance sport. Daytime highs hit 90°F–98°F, humidity peaks, and afternoon thunderstorms create a steamy environment that's perfect for fungal diseases and miserable for gardeners. This is the month you transition from planting mode to maintenance mode.

## What to Plant

**Both regions:**
- This is a lean planting month. The spring window is closed and the fall window hasn't opened yet.
- **Sow Southern peas and okra** — these are the two crops that genuinely love June heat.
- **Start fall tomato and pepper seeds indoors** in mid to late June. Yes, right now. In the Southeast, fall tomato plants must be started indoors in June for transplanting in August.
- **Interplant quick crops:** Plant a row of bush beans between established crops for a last summer harvest.

## What to Harvest

- **Tomatoes** — Peak harvest for spring-planted tomatoes. Harvest daily.
- **Squash and zucchini** — Still producing, though plants are getting tired and disease-stressed.
- **Okra** — Production is ramping up. Harvest every 1–2 days; pods become tough and woody quickly when pods exceed 3–4 inches.
- **Southern peas** — Early plantings begin to produce.
- **Cucumbers** — Winding down as plants succumb to heat and disease.
- **Peppers** — Hot peppers are thriving; bell peppers may slow production.
- **Watermelon and cantaloupe** — Early varieties starting to ripen.
- **Blueberries** — Peak harvest across the Southeast.

## Key Tasks

- **Water.** Water. Water. This is not optional. Daily drip irrigation for most crops.
- **Scout for disease every morning.** In June's humidity, a mild fungal problem on Monday becomes a plant-killing outbreak by Friday.
- **Remove spent spring crops** immediately. Don't let dead pea vines and bolted lettuce sit there breeding disease and sheltering pests.
- **Plan and prepare fall garden beds.** As spring crops come out, amend the soil, let it rest, and solarize if you have nematode or disease issues (see below).
- **Soil solarization:** In the Lower Southeast, June–July is perfect for soil solarization. Clear the bed, water it deeply, cover with clear plastic, and let the sun bake the soil for 4–6 weeks. This kills many soilborne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds. It's one of the most effective organic disease management tools available.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Everything in the May section, amplified.** June's heat and humidity intensify every pest and disease problem.
- **Spider mites** appear on beans, tomatoes, and eggplant in hot, dry spots. Look for stippled yellowing on leaves and fine webbing. Spray with water to knock them off, or use neem oil.
- **Tomato spotted wilt virus** (TSWV) — Spread by thrips. Symptoms include bronze ring spots on fruit and wilting. No cure; remove and destroy affected plants. Resistant varieties are your best prevention.
- **Cucumber beetles** spread bacterial wilt. Once a cucumber plant wilts and doesn't recover overnight, it's gone. Remove it.

## Pro Tips

- **Shade cloth is your friend.** A 30–40% shade cloth over tomatoes and peppers during June–August reduces heat stress, prevents sunscald on fruit, and can extend production by 2–3 weeks. It won't reduce yields — the reduction in temperature more than compensates for the reduction in light.
- **Don't fertilize heat-stressed plants.** If a plant is wilting daily despite adequate water, it's heat-stressed. Fertilizing forces growth the plant can't support and makes the problem worse. Let it survive until temperatures moderate.

# Chapter 11: July — Survival Mode

July in the Southeast is the closest thing we have to a gardening off-season — except it's not an off-season at all. It's the month where the garden requires constant attention (watering, pest management, harvesting) while giving you fewer new planting opportunities. Heat indices regularly exceed 100°F. Humidity is oppressive. Mosquitoes are relentless. And yet, there's food to harvest and work to do.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- Very little new planting this month. Maintain what you have.
- **Continue sowing okra and Southern peas** for succession.
- **Mid to late July:** Start fall broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and collard seeds indoors. These need 6–8 weeks of indoor growth before September transplanting.

**Upper Southeast:**
- **Direct sow:** Bush beans (for fall harvest), summer squash (last succession), Southern peas.
- **Start fall transplants indoors:** Same as Lower Southeast — broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collards.

## What to Harvest

- **Okra** — Peak production. Harvest daily. A 6-inch pod today is a woody stick tomorrow.
- **Southern peas** — Peak production. Shell fresh or blanch and freeze.
- **Tomatoes** — Late spring tomatoes still producing but quality declining. Cracking, blossom end rot, and disease pressure increase.
- **Peppers** — Both sweet and hot peppers producing well.
- **Watermelon and cantaloupe** — Prime harvest month. Thump watermelons; they should sound hollow. Cantaloupes slip from the stem when ripe.
- **Sweet corn** — Harvest when silks are brown and dry. Test a kernel: milky juice = ready; clear juice = wait; doughy = too late.
- **Figs** — If you have a fig tree, this is your month.

## Key Tasks

- **Water relentlessly.** Plants can't tell you they're thirsty until it's almost too late. In July heat, container plants may need water twice daily.
- **Keep harvesting.** Unpicked vegetables drain plant energy and reduce future production.
- **Turn compost piles.** July heat accelerates decomposition. A pile turned weekly can produce finished compost in 4–6 weeks.
- **Take cuttings of herbs.** Basil, rosemary, sage, and mint propagate easily from cuttings stuck in moist potting mix. Start new plants for the fall garden.
- **Order fall seeds** if you haven't already. Fall planting is 4–6 weeks away.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Southern blight** (Sclerotium rolfsii) — A devastating fungal disease that attacks tomatoes, peppers, beans, and many other crops. Look for white, fan-like fungal growth at the soil line, often with small round tan sclerotia (like mustard seeds). Remove affected plants and surrounding soil. This organism persists for years.
- **Nematodes** — Root-knot nematodes cause swollen, knotted root systems. If your tomatoes are stunting and wilting despite adequate water, pull one up and check the roots. Soil solarization and resistant varieties (look for "N" in the disease resistance codes) are your main tools.
- **Armyworms** — Fall armyworms can devastate corn and lawns in July. Check corn leaves for ragged feeding damage and green-brown caterpillars. Bt spray is effective.

## Pro Tips

- **July is mental health month for gardeners.** The spring excitement has worn off, the heat is brutal, and the garden looks rough. This is normal. Every Southeast gardener's July garden looks worse than their April garden. The goal is maintaining production, preparing for fall, and not quitting.
- **Afternoon shade is a feature, not a bug.** If part of your garden gets afternoon shade from trees or buildings, use that area for heat-sensitive crops. In July, a tomato plant with afternoon shade often outproduces one in full sun because it's less heat-stressed.

---

# Chapter 12: August — The Fall Garden Begins

August is the most underrated month in Southeast gardening. Most people have given up by now — their spring garden is exhausted, it's 98°F outside, and gardening feels like punishment. But August is when savvy Southeast gardeners plant their best garden of the year. The fall garden.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Transplant outdoors (mid to late August):** Fall tomatoes, peppers, eggplant (from June-started seedlings). This is the critical window. Transplant in the evening, water heavily, and provide shade cloth for the first week.
- **Direct sow:** Bush beans, cucumbers (short-season variety like 'Spacemaster'), summer squash.
- **Start indoors:** Lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collards (for September–October transplanting).

**Upper Southeast:**
- **Transplant outdoors (late August):** Fall tomatoes and peppers if you have established seedlings.
- **Direct sow:** Bush beans, cucumbers, summer squash.
- **Start indoors:** Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collards, kale.
- **Mid-August:** Direct sow turnips, beets, and carrots for fall harvest.

## What to Harvest

- All July crops continue: okra, Southern peas, peppers, melons.
- **Sweet potatoes** can be harvested now in the Lower Southeast if you planted early. Most gardeners wait until September–October for maximum yield.
- **Muscadine grapes** begin ripening in late August across the Southeast.

## Key Tasks

- **Prepare fall garden beds.** Remove finished summer crops. Add 2–3 inches of compost. If you solarized beds in June/July, remove the plastic and let the soil breathe for a week before planting.
- **Transplant fall crops in the evening.** The heat is still intense. Evening transplanting gives seedlings a full night to recover before facing sun.
- **Provide temporary shade** for new transplants. A shingle or piece of cardboard propped on the south side of a transplant, or 30% shade cloth, makes the difference between survival and death in August.
- **Reduce fertilizer on waning summer crops.** They don't need pushing now — they need to finish producing and gracefully exit.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **All the usual suspects** are still active.
- **Spider mites** often peak in August's hot, dry periods between thunderstorms.
- **Whiteflies** build up on tomatoes and eggplant. Yellow sticky traps help monitor populations. Neem oil or insecticidal soap for control.
- **Fall armyworms** — Check newly planted fall crops for feeding damage. Young plants are vulnerable.

## Pro Tips

- **Fall tomatoes in the Southeast often outperform spring tomatoes.** Here's why: they grow through cooling temperatures rather than rising ones. Disease pressure decreases as humidity drops in fall. There are fewer pest issues. And they can produce until first frost — often giving you 8–10 weeks of harvest compared to the 4–6 week spring window before summer heat shuts them down.
- **Count backward from your first frost date.** Take the days-to-maturity number on the seed packet and add 2 weeks (growth slows as days shorten). That's how far before first frost you need to plant. For a 75-day tomato in an area with a November 15 frost: 75 + 14 = 89 days, meaning you need to transplant by August 18.

---

# Chapter 13: September — The Second Spring

September in the Southeast garden feels like a second spring — and in many ways, it is. Temperatures are moderating, the insane humidity of July and August is finally breaking, and you're planting cool-season crops with the same excitement you felt in March. This is the month that separates year-round Southeast gardeners from spring-only gardeners.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Transplant outdoors:** Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collards, kale, Brussels sprouts.
- **Direct sow:** Lettuce, spinach, radishes, turnips, beets, carrots, Swiss chard, mustard greens, arugula, snap peas (late September).
- **Plant garlic cloves** in late September through October (see Chapter 20).
- **Sow cover crops** on empty beds: crimson clover, Austrian winter peas, or annual ryegrass.

**Upper Southeast:**
- **Same as Lower Southeast** but 2–3 weeks earlier in the month due to earlier frost.
- **Direct sow cool-season crops** by mid-September for best results.
- **Transplant:** Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collards in early September.
- **Plant garlic** in mid to late October (note: later than Lower SE).

## What to Harvest

- **Fall tomatoes and peppers** — production is ramping up in the Lower Southeast.
- **Bush beans** — Fall planting is producing.
- **Okra** — Still going strong. Will produce until frost.
- **Sweet potatoes** — Prime harvest month. Dig when vines start yellowing or before first frost, whichever comes first.
- **Winter squash** — Harvest when stems are dry and hard and skin resists a thumbnail scratch.
- **Pumpkins** — Harvest when fully colored and stem is dry.

## Key Tasks

- **Keep watering fall crops.** September can be dry, and young transplants need consistent moisture.
- **Monitor fall tomato plants** for blight. These plants are your best producers — protect them.
- **Cure sweet potatoes** after digging. Let them sit in a warm (80–85°F), humid space for 10–14 days. This heals skin wounds and converts starches to sugars. Don't wash them until ready to use.
- **Seed cool-season crops in succession.** Plant lettuce every 2 weeks for continuous harvest.
- **Prepare row covers and cold frames** for upcoming cold weather. Have them ready before you need them.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Cabbage loopers and cabbageworms** are active on fall brassicas. Inspect frequently, use Bt spray.
- **Aphids** — Fall aphid populations can explode on cool-season crops. Neem oil, insecticidal soap, or a hard water spray.
- **Harlequin bugs** — Strikingly patterned orange-and-black stink bugs that love brassicas. Hand-pick and destroy. These are harder to control than they look.
- Pest pressure overall is declining. Celebrate this.

## Pro Tips

- **September plantings of lettuce, spinach, and radishes grow faster than spring plantings** because the soil is warm (seeds germinate quickly) and the air is cooling (plants don't bolt). It's the best of both worlds.
- **This is your cover crop window.** Any bed that won't be used until spring should get a cover crop. Crimson clover fixes nitrogen, suppresses weeds, prevents erosion, and looks beautiful. Mow or turn it under 3–4 weeks before spring planting.

---

# Chapter 14: October — Peak Fall Harvest

October is arguably the best gardening month in the Southeast. The weather is perfect — 65–80°F days, cool nights, low humidity. The fall garden is in full production. Pests and diseases are at their lowest point since spring. This is your reward for surviving summer.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Direct sow:** Lettuce, spinach, radishes, arugula, turnips, mustard greens (continue successions).
- **Plant garlic cloves.** Space 6 inches apart, 2 inches deep, pointed end up. Mulch with 3–4 inches of straw.
- **Plant onion seeds** in flats for spring transplanting (or order transplants for January delivery).
- **Sow cover crops** on any remaining empty beds.
- **Transplant** any remaining cool-season crops.

**Upper Southeast:**
- **Direct sow:** Lettuce (under row cover), spinach, radishes. These are your last chances for direct sowing before cold weather.
- **Plant garlic** mid to late October. This is the ideal window — garlic needs several weeks of root growth before the ground freezes.
- **Sow cover crops.**
- **Plant tulip, daffodil, and other spring-blooming bulbs** (not vegetables, but worth mentioning — they attract early pollinators to your spring garden).

## What to Harvest

- **Everything cool-season:** Lettuce, spinach, radishes, turnips, beets, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, collards, kale, Swiss chard, mustard greens.
- **Fall tomatoes and peppers** — still producing in the Lower Southeast. Protect from early frost.
- **Okra** — final harvests before frost kills the plants.
- **Sweet potatoes** — Last chance to dig in the Upper Southeast before frost.
- **Winter squash and pumpkins** — Should all be harvested and stored by month's end.
- **Fall bush beans** — harvest and freeze extras.

## Key Tasks

- **Watch frost forecasts.** Upper Southeast can get first frost as early as mid-October. Lower Southeast usually stays frost-free through November, but cold pockets can surprise you.
- **Protect tender crops from frost.** Row cover (frost blanket) adds 4–8°F of protection. Drape it over tomato cages, pepper plants, and other frost-sensitive crops on cold nights.
- **Clean up summer crop remains.** Remove all dead plant material, especially diseased plants. Don't compost diseased material — bag it and discard.
- **Prepare storage** for winter squash, sweet potatoes, and dried beans. Cool, dark, dry conditions (55–60°F) are ideal.
- **Add leaves to compost.** October leaf fall is a compost goldmine. Shred leaves first (run over them with a mower) for faster decomposition.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Pest pressure is minimal** — celebrate with a cold beer in the garden.
- **Cabbage aphids** may still be present on brassicas.
- **Deer** become more active and hungry as wild food sources diminish. Fencing is the only reliable deterrent.

## Pro Tips

- **October is the best month for soil improvement.** After clearing summer beds, spread 3–4 inches of compost, throw down cover crop seed, and let biology work all winter. Your spring soil will be dramatically better.
- **Save seeds from your best-performing plants.** Open-pollinated varieties (not hybrids) will produce true-to-type offspring. Let your best tomato, pepper, and bean plants mature fully. Dry seeds thoroughly and store in a cool, dry place.

---

# Chapter 15: November — Winding Down, Not Stopping

November is the Southeast's transition month. In the Upper Southeast, the garden is going dormant — hard frosts have killed tender crops, and the focus shifts to cold-hardy greens and season extension. In the Lower Southeast, the garden is still very much alive. Cool-season crops are in full swing, and with minimal protection, you can harvest through the holidays and beyond.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Direct sow (under row cover):** Lettuce, spinach, radishes, carrots (slow growers — these won't mature until late winter/spring but will overwinter as small plants).
- **Plant onion transplants** from November through January (short-day varieties for the Southeast: 'Texas 1015Y', 'Granex 33', 'Vidalia Sweet').
- **Garlic** — still plantable in the Lower SE through early November if you haven't yet.

**Upper Southeast:**
- **Very little outdoor planting.** Garlic if not planted in October. Overwintering spinach under row cover.
- **Focus shifts** to cold frame and indoor growing if you have the infrastructure.

## What to Harvest

- **Collards, kale, and Brussels sprouts** — These actually improve after a frost. Cold converts starches to sugars, sweetening the flavor. Don't rush to pick them.
- **Turnips, beets, carrots, radishes** — Root crops are at peak sweetness.
- **Lettuce and spinach** — Fall plantings still producing.
- **Broccoli and cauliflower** — Fall-planted heads maturing.
- **Fall tomatoes and peppers** — Still possible in the Lower Southeast if frost hasn't hit. Harvest all remaining fruit before the first hard freeze.
- **Pecans** — Not a vegetable, but every Southeast gardener picks up pecans in November.

## Key Tasks

- **Protect your fall garden from hard freezes.** Row cover, cold frames, and mulch are your tools. Most cool-season crops survive temperatures into the mid-20s°F. Some (collards, kale, spinach, carrots under mulch) survive into the teens.
- **Remove all frost-killed warm-season crop debris.** Clean up tomato cages, remove dead vines, pull out any remaining stakes. This reduces overwintering pest habitat.
- **Winterize irrigation systems** in the Upper Southeast. Drain hoses and drip lines before hard freezes.
- **Continue composting.** Fall leaves + kitchen scraps + garden debris = spring compost.
- **Spread lime if your soil test calls for it.** It takes 2–3 months to significantly change pH, so fall/winter application is ideal for spring planting.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Minimal.** Cold weather has eliminated most pest issues.
- **Slugs** can be active in cool, wet conditions on fall greens. Iron phosphate bait.
- **Deer and rabbits** — Hunger drives them to your garden as wild food disappears.

## Pro Tips

- **Mulch carrots, beets, and turnips heavily (6+ inches of straw) and leave them in the ground as a living root cellar.** They'll stay fresh and sweet all winter and can be dug as needed. This works in both Upper and Lower Southeast.
- **Thanksgiving from the garden:** It's entirely possible to harvest collards, sweet potatoes, turnips, winter squash, pecans, and fresh herbs from your Southeast garden for Thanksgiving dinner. Plan for this next year — it's deeply satisfying.

# Chapter 16: December — Rest, Reflect, Repeat

December is the quietest month in the Southeast garden, but it's not silent. In the Lower Southeast, cold-hardy crops continue producing under row cover. In the Upper Southeast, the garden is dormant, but there's still work to do. And in both regions, December is when you evaluate the year and plan the next one.

## What to Plant

**Lower Southeast:**
- **Not much.** Some gardeners in zone 9a (coastal Louisiana, far southern GA/SC) can still plant lettuce, spinach, and radishes under row cover.
- **Indoor seed starting** for earliest spring crops can begin late December in the Lower Southeast (onions, celery — slow-growing crops that need a head start).

**Upper Southeast:**
- Nothing outdoors. Rest.
- Begin browsing seed catalogs. This is a legitimate gardening activity.

## What to Harvest

- **Cold-hardy greens** continue: collards, kale, spinach (all improve with cold).
- **Root crops** still in the ground under mulch: carrots, beets, turnips, parsnips.
- **Brussels sprouts** — Often best in December after repeated frosts.
- **Leeks** — Hardy to well below zero. Harvest anytime.
- **Winter herbs:** Rosemary, thyme, and parsley remain productive through most of the Southeast.

## Key Tasks

- **Protect crops during hard freezes.** A hard freeze (below 28°F for 4+ hours) can damage even cold-hardy crops. Double-layer row cover, or cover beds with old blankets/tarps on the coldest nights. Remove covers when temperatures rise above freezing.
- **Review your garden journal.** What performed best? Worst? What diseases showed up? What varieties will you replant? Write down your top 5 successes and top 5 failures.
- **Order seed catalogs** (or bookmark online stores). Key companies for Southeast gardeners:
  - Southern Exposure Seed Exchange (Mineral, VA) — heirloom and open-pollinated varieties bred for the Southeast
  - Sow True Seed (Asheville, NC) — organic and heirloom seeds for Southern Appalachia and beyond
  - Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds — massive selection, great catalog
  - Johnny's Selected Seeds — professional quality, detailed variety information
  - Seed Savers Exchange — heirloom preservation
- **Maintain tools.** Sharpen pruners, hoes, and shovels. Oil wooden handles with linseed oil. Clean and store pots and trays.
- **Turn and maintain compost piles.** December's cool weather slows decomposition but doesn't stop it.

## Pest & Disease Watch

- **Essentially none.** This is the one month you can relax on pest scouting.
- **Check stored sweet potatoes and winter squash** for rot. Remove any spoiling specimens immediately before they ruin their neighbors.

## Pro Tips

- **The Southeast garden never truly stops.** Even in December, in even the coldest parts of the Upper Southeast, garlic is growing roots underground, cover crops are protecting soil, and microorganisms are processing the compost and amendments you applied in fall. The visible garden may look dormant, but the invisible garden is working hard.
- **Reflect on the year. Plan the next.** December garden planning — sitting with seed catalogs, a cup of coffee, and a sketch pad — is one of the great joys of gardening. You're not just looking at pretty pictures; you're engineering next year's food supply based on this year's experience.

# Part III: Vegetable Profiles

# Chapter 17: Warm-Season Vegetables A–L

These crops need warm soil and warm air to thrive. Plant after your last spring frost date, or in mid-summer for fall harvest. They die at first frost (with a few exceptions noted).

## Beans, Bush

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★★ — One of the easiest and most rewarding crops.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Contender' — Widely adapted, tolerant of heat and less-than-perfect conditions. 50 days.
- 'Provider' — Germinates well in cool soil (good for early spring planting). 50 days.
- 'Blue Lake 274' — Classic flavor, bush habit. 55 days.
- 'Roma II' — Flat Italian type, disease-resistant. 55 days.
- 'Jade' — Slim, dark green pods, excellent flavor. 60 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow March 15–April 15 (spring), August 1–September 1 (fall)
- Upper SE: Direct sow April 15–May 15 (spring), July 15–August 15 (fall)

**Spacing:** 4–6 inches apart in rows 24 inches apart. Plant seeds 1 inch deep.

**Soil temperature for germination:** 60°F minimum, 70–80°F ideal.

**Care:** Beans fix nitrogen — don't over-fertilize, especially with nitrogen-heavy fertilizers, or you'll get beautiful plants with few beans. Water consistently during flowering and pod development. Mulch to keep soil cool and moist.

**Harvest:** Pick when pods are firm and pencil-thick but before seeds bulge visibly. Harvest every 2–3 days — regular picking prolongs production. Expect 3–4 weeks of harvest from each planting.

**Common problems:**
- Bean beetles (Mexican bean beetle): Hand-pick or use pyrethrin spray.
- Rust: Orange-brown spots on leaf undersides. Use resistant varieties; avoid overhead watering.
- Anthracnose: Dark, sunken spots on pods. Buy disease-free seed; rotate annually.

**Pro Tip:** For continuous harvest, plant a new row every 2 weeks from first planting date through the end of the spring window, then resume for the fall window.

---

## Beans, Pole

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Higher yield per square foot than bush beans but require trellising.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Kentucky Wonder' — The classic. Excellent fresh and for drying. 65 days.
- 'Rattlesnake' — Heat-tolerant heirloom, purple-streaked pods. 75 days.
- 'Blue Lake Pole' — Same flavor as bush Blue Lake, bigger plants. 65 days.
- 'Fortex' — Extra-long, slim French filet type. 60 days.

**When to plant:** Same windows as bush beans, but pole beans produce over a longer period (6–8 weeks).

**Trellis:** Provide 6–8 feet of vertical support. Teepees, cattle panels, or string trellises all work.

**Pro Tip:** 'Rattlesnake' is the most heat-tolerant pole bean available and a Southeast heirloom worth growing for both beauty and performance.

---

## Corn, Sweet

**Southeast rating:** ★★★ — Requires space and attention but nothing beats fresh corn.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Silver Queen' (white, 92 days) — The Southeast standard. Heat-tolerant, excellent flavor.
- 'Peaches and Cream' (bicolor, 83 days) — Earlier, very sweet.
- 'Bodacious' (yellow, 75 days) — Early, supersweet (se+) type.
- 'Ambrosia' (bicolor, 75 days) — Synergistic type, tender, very sweet.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow March 15–April 30. Successive plantings every 2 weeks.
- Upper SE: Direct sow April 15–May 31.

**Spacing:** 12 inches apart in rows 30–36 inches apart. Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows (not single long rows) for pollination.

**Care:** Corn is a heavy feeder. Side-dress with nitrogen fertilizer when plants are knee-high and again when tassels appear. Water deeply during silking — drought stress during pollination = missing kernels.

**Harvest:** 18–22 days after silks appear. Silks should be brown and dry. Pierce a kernel with your fingernail — milky juice means ready.

**Common problems:**
- Corn earworms: Apply mineral oil or Bt to silk tips when silks first appear.
- Fall armyworms: Inspect whorl leaves for ragged feeding damage.
- Poor pollination (missing kernels): Plant in blocks, not rows.

**Pro Tip:** Don't plant supersweet (sh2) varieties next to standard (su) or sugar-enhanced (se) varieties. Cross-pollination makes all types starchy. Isolate by 250 feet or 2 weeks of planting time.

---

## Cucumbers

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Prolific but disease-prone in our humidity.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Marketmore 76' — Disease-resistant slicer, the standard. 58 days.
- 'Straight Eight' — Heirloom slicer, reliable. 58 days.
- 'Diva' — Seedless, thin-skinned, very disease-resistant. 58 days.
- 'National Pickling' — Compact, heavy producer for pickles. 52 days.
- 'Spacemaster' — Compact vine for containers and small spaces. 56 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow March 15–April 30 (spring), August 1–15 (fall)
- Upper SE: Direct sow April 15–May 31 (spring), July 15–August 1 (fall)

**Spacing:** 12 inches apart on trellises, or 36 inches apart on the ground.

**Care:** **Trellis them.** This is not optional in the Southeast. Trellising keeps fruit off the ground (reducing rot and slug damage), improves air circulation (reducing disease), and saves space. Any 5–6 foot vertical support works.

**Harvest:** Pick at 6–8 inches for slicers, 3–4 inches for picklers. Check daily — cucumbers grow fast. Remove any yellowing or oversized fruit immediately; they signal the plant to stop producing.

**Common problems:**
- Downy mildew: Angular yellow patches on leaf tops, gray-purple fuzz underneath. Fungicide preventatively.
- Powdery mildew: White powder on leaf surfaces. Use resistant varieties.
- Cucumber beetles: Spread bacterial wilt. Row cover until flowering; trap crops.
- Bacterial wilt: Plant wilts suddenly on hot afternoon and doesn't recover overnight. No cure; remove plant.

**Pro Tip:** For fall cucumbers, start seeds indoors 3 weeks before transplant date. Direct-sown fall cucumbers often struggle in hot August soil — transplants establish faster.

---

## Eggplant

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Thrives in our heat when most other crops suffer.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Black Beauty' — Classic large Italian type. 80 days.
- 'Ichiban' — Long, slender Japanese type, very productive. 70 days.
- 'Orient Express' — Heat-tolerant Asian type. 58 days.
- 'Rosa Bianca' — Beautiful Italian heirloom, mild flavor. 75 days.
- 'Florida Market' — Bred for the Southeast. Large, productive. 85 days.

**When to plant:**
- Start indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant date.
- Lower SE: Transplant outdoors April 1–May 1 (spring), August 1–15 (fall)
- Upper SE: Transplant outdoors May 1–June 1

**Spacing:** 24 inches apart, rows 36 inches apart.

**Care:** Eggplant loves heat even more than tomatoes and peppers. It's one of the last crops to go in and one of the last to stop producing. Stake or cage plants — loaded branches break. Consistent water during fruit development prevents bitterness.

**Harvest:** Pick when skin is glossy and firm. If the skin turns dull or brown seeds are visible inside, it's overripe and bitter.

**Common problems:**
- Flea beetles: Tiny holes in leaves. Row cover or kaolin clay spray until plants are well-established.
- Colorado potato beetle: Hand-pick; Bt var. tenebrionis for heavy infestations.
- Verticillium wilt: Use grafted plants or resistant rootstock.

**Pro Tip:** Asian eggplant varieties ('Ichiban', 'Orient Express') produce faster and more prolifically in Southeast heat than traditional Italian types. If you've struggled with eggplant, try an Asian variety.

---

## Field Peas (Southern Peas)

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★★ — The ultimate Southeast crop. Thrives in heat, fixes nitrogen, produces abundantly.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Mississippi Silver' (cream type) — The gold standard for production and flavor. 64 days.
- 'Pinkeye Purple Hull' — Beloved across the Deep South. Easy to shell. 60 days.
- 'California Blackeye #5' — Classic black-eyed pea, disease-resistant. 65 days.
- 'Zipper Cream' — Extra-easy shelling, excellent flavor. 70 days.
- 'Red Ripper' (cowpea) — Extremely heat and drought tolerant. Also an excellent cover crop. 90 days.
- 'Whippoorwill' — Heirloom crowder pea, rich, earthy flavor. 80 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow April 15–July 15. Multiple successions.
- Upper SE: Direct sow May 15–July 1.

**Spacing:** 4–6 inches apart in rows 24–36 inches apart. Plant seeds 1–1.5 inches deep.

**Soil temperature for germination:** 65°F minimum, 75–90°F ideal. Don't rush these into cool soil.

**Care:** Field peas are almost embarrassingly easy. They fix nitrogen (don't fertilize), tolerate poor soil, handle drought better than almost any vegetable, and actually produce more in heat. The only thing they don't like is wet feet — ensure good drainage.

**Harvest:** For snap peas (fresh eating), harvest when pods are plump but still green. For shell peas, wait until pods are full and beginning to change color (silver, purple, or tan depending on variety). For dry peas, leave pods on the plant until dry and papery.

**Shelling tip:** Fresh peas shell easiest if refrigerated for an hour first. For large quantities, invest in a hand-cranked pea sheller ($30–50) — it will save your thumbs and your marriage.

**Preservation:** Blanch shelled peas 2 minutes, ice bath, drain, freeze flat on baking sheets, then bag. They freeze beautifully for 6–12 months.

**Common problems:** Virtually none in proper conditions. Cowpea curculio can damage seeds inside pods. Stink bugs feed on developing peas. Neither is usually a severe problem.

**Pro Tip:** Plant 'Red Ripper' cowpeas as a summer cover crop on beds that won't be used until fall. They fix nitrogen, suppress weeds, and tolerate neglect. Cut them down and turn them under 2–3 weeks before planting fall crops. Free nitrogen.

---

## Lima Beans (Butter Beans)

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — A Southern staple that loves heat.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Henderson Bush' — Small (baby) lima, compact plant. 65 days.
- 'Jackson Wonder' — Speckled bush type, Southeast heirloom. 65 days.
- 'Florida Speckled Butter Bean' (pole) — Large, flavorful, heat-tolerant. 85 days.
- 'Christmas' (pole) — Beautiful large red-speckled beans. 90 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow April 15–July 1
- Upper SE: Direct sow May 15–June 15

**Spacing:** Bush types: 6 inches apart, rows 24–30 inches. Pole types: 8 inches apart on trellises.

**Care:** Similar to field peas. Limas need consistently warm temperatures (above 65°F nights) to set pods. They're more heat-tolerant than common beans and actually produce better in summer heat. Don't over-fertilize.

**Harvest:** When pods are plump and fully filled. Shell and freeze, or dry on the vine for long-term storage.

**Pro Tip:** In the Southeast, "butter beans" refers to lima beans. At farmers' markets and seed swaps, use the local terminology — "butter beans" will get you better recommendations than "limas."

---

## Melons (Watermelon and Cantaloupe)

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Excellent in the Lower Southeast; requires more effort in the Upper Southeast.

**Watermelon Varieties:**
- 'Crimson Sweet' — The classic picnic watermelon. 85 days.
- 'Sugar Baby' — Personal-sized (8–10 lbs), perfect for small gardens. 75 days.
- 'Charleston Gray' — Oblong, thick rind (great for rind pickles). 85 days. Southeast heirloom.
- 'Moon and Stars' — Stunning heirloom with spotted skin. 90 days.

**Cantaloupe Varieties:**
- 'Ambrosia' — Superb flavor, some disease resistance. 86 days.
- 'Athena' — Commercial standard, excellent disease resistance. 75 days.
- 'Hale's Best Jumbo' — Heirloom, intense flavor. 85 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow April 1–May 15 (or transplant April 1–15)
- Upper SE: Start indoors 3–4 weeks before last frost; transplant after all frost danger. Direct sow May 1–June 1.

**Spacing:** Watermelons: 36–48 inches apart in rows 6–8 feet apart (they sprawl). Cantaloupes: 24–36 inches in rows 5–6 feet apart.

**Care:** Melons are heavy feeders and heavy drinkers during fruit development. Water deeply until fruits are nearly ripe, then reduce watering — excess water at ripening reduces sweetness. Apply fertilizer at planting and when runners begin to spread. Lay mulch or place boards under developing fruit to prevent rot.

**Harvest:** Watermelon: thump (hollow sound = ripe), check the ground spot (should be creamy yellow, not white), tendril nearest the fruit should be dry/brown. Cantaloupe: ripe fruit "slips" from the stem with gentle pressure. If you have to pull, it's not ready.

**Common problems:**
- Fusarium wilt: Use resistant varieties (look for "F" in variety descriptions).
- Anthracnose: Fungal spots on leaves and fruit. Crop rotation and fungicide.
- Cucumber beetles and squash bugs.
- Vine borers less common on melons than squash.

**Pro Tip:** 'Charleston Gray' watermelon was bred in Charleston, SC — it's literally a Southeast native and performs exceptionally in our conditions. The thick rind also makes excellent pickled watermelon rind, a Southern delicacy.

# Chapter 18: Warm-Season Vegetables M–Z

## Okra

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★★ — If the Southeast had an official vegetable, it would be okra.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Clemson Spineless' — The standard. Smooth pods, spineless, prolific. 56 days.
- 'Burgundy' — Red pods (turn green when cooked), ornamental and productive. 60 days.
- 'Jambalaya' — Compact plant, good for containers. 50 days.
- 'Cow Horn' — Heirloom, large pods that stay tender longer. 55 days.
- 'Star of David' — Israeli heirloom, fat ridged pods, excellent grilled. 60 days.
- 'Hill Country Heirloom Red' — Beautiful, productive, heat-loving. 65 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow April 1–June 15 (soil must be 65°F+)
- Upper SE: Direct sow May 1–June 15

**Spacing:** 12–18 inches apart in rows 36 inches apart. Okra plants get BIG — 4–8 feet tall.

**Seed prep:** Okra seeds have a hard coat. Soak seeds in warm water for 8–12 hours before planting to speed germination (from 2 weeks down to 5–7 days). Alternatively, nick the seed coat with nail clippers.

**Care:** Okra is the most heat-tolerant common vegetable. It actually produces better when temperatures exceed 90°F — the exact conditions that shut down most other crops. Minimal fertilizer needed after establishment. Water regularly during drought but okra tolerates dry spells better than most vegetables.

**Harvest:** Pick pods at 3–4 inches long (2–3 inches for 'Clemson Spineless'). Check daily — okra grows fast in summer heat, and a tender 3-inch pod today will be a woody, inedible 8-inch pod in two days. Use a sharp knife or pruners; pods are tough to pull off. Wear long sleeves — okra leaves and stems have spiny hairs that irritate skin.

**Preservation:** Slice and freeze (blanching optional — many Southern cooks freeze raw). Pickle whole small pods. Bread and freeze for fried okra later.

**Common problems:** Almost none. That's why it's rated 5 stars. Occasionally aphids on new growth, Japanese beetles on leaves. Neither is usually serious.

**Pro Tip:** When okra plants reach 4 feet and pod production slows, cut them back to 12–18 inches. They'll regrow and produce a second flush of pods in fall. This trick extends harvest by 3–4 weeks.

---

## Peppers, Sweet

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Excellent in our heat, with long production windows.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Big Bertha' — Large bell, thick walls, reliable. 72 days.
- 'King Arthur' — Disease-resistant bell, heavy yields. 72 days.
- 'Carmen' (Italian) — Sweet, horn-shaped, excellent roasted. 75 days.
- 'Gypsy' — Early, prolific, wedge-shaped. 60 days.
- 'Lunchbox Mix' — Small snack peppers, insanely productive. 60 days.

**Varieties for hot peppers:**
- 'Early Jalapeño' — Standard heat, compact plant. 65 days.
- 'Cayenne Long Slim' — Classic for drying. 72 days.
- 'Habanero' — Extreme heat, loves Southeast summers. 95 days.
- 'Fish Pepper' — Beautiful variegated heirloom, medium heat. 80 days.
- 'Carolina Reaper' — If you dare. Bred in South Carolina. 120 days.

**When to plant:**
- Start indoors 8–10 weeks before transplant date.
- Lower SE: Transplant April 1–May 1 (spring), August 1–15 (fall)
- Upper SE: Transplant May 1–June 1

**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart, rows 30–36 inches apart.

**Care:** Peppers need consistent moisture and moderate fertilization. Too much nitrogen = lots of leaves, few peppers. Switch to a phosphorus-heavy fertilizer when plants begin flowering. Hot peppers tolerate Southeast summer heat better than sweet peppers. Bell peppers may stop setting fruit when nighttime temps exceed 75°F, but hot peppers keep going.

**Harvest:** Sweet peppers can be harvested green or left to ripen to red/yellow/orange (sweeter, more nutritious, but takes longer). Hot peppers develop more heat as they ripen. Cut peppers from the plant with pruners — pulling can break branches.

**Common problems:**
- Blossom end rot: Black, sunken bottoms on fruit. Caused by inconsistent watering (calcium can't reach fruit when water is inconsistent). Mulch and water evenly.
- Aphids on new growth.
- Bacterial leaf spot: Brown, angular spots on leaves. Copper spray preventatively.
- Sunscald: White, papery patches on sun-exposed fruit. Maintain good leaf canopy.

**Pro Tip:** Southeast fall peppers can be spectacular. Transplant in August, and as temperatures cool in September–October, peppers ripen to full color more reliably than in the heat of summer. Protect from frost with row cover and you can harvest peppers through Thanksgiving in the Lower Southeast.

---

## Squash, Summer (Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Pattypan)

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Prolific and easy, but squash vine borers are the archenemy.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Black Beauty' (zucchini) — Classic, prolific. 50 days.
- 'Dunja' (zucchini) — Powdery mildew resistant, excellent for Southeast. 47 days.
- 'Golden Zucchini' — Same productivity, easier to spot for harvest. 50 days.
- 'Yellow Crookneck' — Traditional Southern favorite. 50 days.
- 'Straightneck Early Prolific' — Reliable yellow squash. 50 days.
- 'Benning's Green Tint' (pattypan/scallop) — Southeast heirloom, excellent flavor. 52 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow March 15–April 30 (spring), August 1–15 (fall)
- Upper SE: Direct sow April 15–May 31 (spring), July 15–August 1 (fall)

**Spacing:** 24–36 inches apart in rows 36–48 inches apart.

**Care:** Squash grows fast and produces heavily. Feed monthly with balanced fertilizer. Water at the base (drip irrigation) to reduce disease. Harvest every 1–2 days; oversized squash taste terrible and drain the plant.

**Harvest:** Zucchini at 6–8 inches, yellow squash at 5–7 inches, pattypan at 3–4 inches diameter. Smaller is better for flavor and texture.

**THE BIG PROBLEM — Squash Vine Borers:**

Squash vine borers are the #1 nemesis of Southeast squash growers. The adult is a wasp-like moth that lays eggs at the base of squash stems. Larvae bore into stems and feed internally, causing sudden wilting and death.

**Prevention strategies:**
1. **Row cover** from planting until flowering (remove for pollination or hand-pollinate).
2. **Wrap stem bases** with aluminum foil or nylon stocking from soil level up 6 inches.
3. **Succession plant.** Assume your first planting will be killed. Plant a second round 3 weeks later.
4. **Plant resistant species.** Butternut squash and Tromboncino (a.k.a. zucchetta) are much more resistant to vine borers than zucchini and yellow squash.
5. **Inject Bt** into stems at first sign of frass (sawdust at stem base). Use a syringe to inject Bt solution into the stem just above the entry hole.
6. **Fall planting** avoids the worst borer pressure because borer populations decline by August.

**Pro Tip:** 'Tromboncino' (Italian heirloom, also called zucchetta) is a vigorous climbing squash that's nearly immune to vine borers because of its solid stems. It tastes like zucchini when harvested young, grows on a trellis, and produces heavily in Southeast conditions. If vine borers have beaten you repeatedly, this is your answer.

## Squash, Winter (Butternut, Acorn, Spaghetti, etc.)

**Southeast rating:** ★★★ — More challenging than summer squash due to longer growing season and pest pressure.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Waltham Butternut' — The standard. Disease-resistant, stores well. 100 days.
- 'Butterbush' — Compact butternut for small gardens. 75 days.
- 'Table Ace' (acorn) — Reliable, compact vine. 78 days.
- 'Spaghetti Squash' — Reliable, fun, stores well. 90 days.
- 'Seminole Pumpkin' — Florida/Southeast heirloom, extremely heat and pest resistant. 95 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow April 1–May 15
- Upper SE: Direct sow May 1–June 1
- Count backward from first frost to ensure maturity before cold weather.

**Care:** Same as summer squash but requires more space and a longer growing season. Butternut types are more vine borer resistant than acorn types (butternut has harder stems).

**Harvest:** When skin is hard and resists a thumbnail scratch. Leave 2 inches of stem attached. Cure in a warm (80°F), dry place for 10 days before long-term storage. Properly cured butternut stores 3–6 months at 50–60°F.

**Pro Tip:** 'Seminole Pumpkin' is an incredible Southeast-adapted squash that most gardeners outside Florida have never heard of. Native Americans grew it in the Southeast for centuries. It tolerates heat, humidity, and poor soil better than any other winter squash, resists vine borers and downy mildew, and stores for months. The flavor is similar to butternut. Source seeds from Southern Exposure Seed Exchange or Florida seed companies.

## Sweet Potatoes

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★★ — Effortless in our climate. The set-it-and-forget-it crop.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Beauregard' — The commercial standard. Orange flesh, early, high yield. 90 days.
- 'Covington' — Developed at NC State. Excellent flavor, good disease resistance. 90 days.
- 'Jewel' — Deep orange, stores well. 100 days.
- 'Georgia Jet' — Very early (fast to mature), good for the Upper Southeast. 90 days.
- 'O'Henry' — White-fleshed, sweet, excellent baked. 100 days.
- 'Murasaki' — Japanese variety, purple skin, white flesh, drier texture. 100 days.

**When to plant:**
- Plant slips (not seeds) after soil reaches 65°F and all frost danger is past.
- Lower SE: May 1–June 15
- Upper SE: May 15–June 15

**Where to get slips:** Order from slip suppliers (Steele Plant Company, Scott Farms, George's Plant Farm) or grow your own. To grow slips: 6 weeks before planting, suspend a sweet potato halfway in a jar of water (toothpicks), set in a warm, sunny window. Shoots (slips) grow from the eyes. When slips are 6–8 inches long with roots, twist them off and plant.

**Spacing:** 12–18 inches apart in rows 36–48 inches apart. Plant slips 4–6 inches deep, burying all but the top 2–3 leaves.

**Care:** After planting, water regularly for the first 2 weeks while slips establish. After that, sweet potatoes need almost nothing. Seriously. They tolerate drought, poor soil, and heat. Don't fertilize heavily — excess nitrogen produces beautiful vines and tiny tubers. Once vines cover the bed, weeds can't compete.

**Harvest:** 90–120 days after planting, or before first frost, whichever comes first. Dig carefully with a garden fork — sweet potato tubers are fragile and bruise easily. Shake off soil but don't wash.

**Curing:** Critical for flavor and storage. Spread tubers in a warm (80–85°F), humid location for 10–14 days. A covered porch, a garage with a space heater, or a warm room with a pan of water works. After curing, store at 55–60°F. Never refrigerate sweet potatoes — cold turns their starch to hard, off-flavored matter. Properly cured sweet potatoes store 6–12 months.

**Common problems:** Sweet potato weevil (primarily coastal areas). Wireworms. Root-knot nematodes. All are generally manageable. The biggest "problem" is usually producing more sweet potatoes than you know what to do with.

**Pro Tip:** Sweet potatoes are a soil-building crop. Their deep roots break up compacted subsoil, their dense canopy suppresses weeds and shades soil, and the extensive root system feeds soil biology. Plant sweet potatoes in your worst soil — they'll improve it while feeding you.

## Tomatoes

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — The most popular garden crop and the most challenging in our climate.

Let's be honest: growing tomatoes in the Southeast is harder than growing them almost anywhere else. The combination of heat, humidity, and disease pressure means you'll fight for every tomato. But with the right varieties, timing, and prevention, you can harvest abundantly. The key is accepting that your tomato season has limits and working within them.

**Varieties for the Southeast (disease resistance is NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

*Determinate (bush) types for concentrated harvest:*
- 'Celebrity' — VFFNT disease resistance. Reliable, mid-size fruit. 72 days.
- 'Mountain Magic' — Late blight resistant, crack resistant. 66 days.
- 'Defiant' — Late blight, early blight, and septoria resistant. 70 days.
- 'Mountain Merit' — Multiple disease resistance including late blight. 75 days.
- 'Iron Lady' — Late blight, early blight, septoria triple resistance. 75 days.

*Indeterminate (vining) types for extended harvest:*
- 'Better Boy' — VFN, large fruit, Southeast classic. 75 days.
- 'Cherokee Purple' — Heirloom, incredible flavor, but disease-susceptible. 80 days.
- 'Sun Gold' (cherry) — Indeterminate, incredibly sweet, highly productive. 57 days.
- 'Juliet' (grape) — Disease-resistant, crack-resistant, produces until frost. 60 days.
- 'Matt's Wild Cherry' — Virtually indestructible, tiny fruit, huge production. 60 days.

**When to plant:**
- Start indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant date.
- Lower SE: Transplant March 15–April 15 (spring), August 1–20 (fall)
- Upper SE: Transplant April 15–May 15 (spring), July 15–August 10 (fall)

**Spacing:** 24–36 inches apart, rows 36–48 inches apart. More space = more airflow = less disease.

**The Southeast Tomato Strategy:**

1. **Choose disease-resistant varieties.** Those letter codes after variety names matter: V (verticillium wilt), F (fusarium wilt), N (nematodes), T (tobacco mosaic virus), A (alternaria). In the Southeast, look for as many letters as possible plus late blight resistance.

2. **Mulch at planting.** 3–4 inches of straw around (not touching) stems. This prevents soil-borne spores from splashing onto lower leaves during rain — the primary infection route for early blight and septoria.

3. **Prune and stake.** Remove suckers below the first flower cluster. Stake or cage aggressively. Get foliage off the ground and air circulating.

4. **Preventative fungicide.** Start applying copper fungicide or chlorothalonil before you see any disease, beginning 2 weeks after transplanting and continuing every 7–10 days. This is controversial advice in some gardening circles. It is also the reality of growing tomatoes in the humid Southeast.

5. **Water at the base.** Drip irrigation only. Never overhead water tomatoes.

6. **Plant a fall crop.** Fall tomatoes in the Southeast often outperform spring tomatoes because they grow into cooling weather, and disease pressure drops as humidity decreases. This is your secret weapon.

**Harvest:** Pick at first color break (when green starts turning pink) and ripen indoors for best results in Southeast conditions. This prevents cracking from rain, reduces bird/insect damage, and doesn't affect flavor. Counter-ripened tomatoes taste the same as vine-ripened — this is scientifically established.

**Common problems:**
- Early blight (brown spots with concentric rings on lower leaves) — the #1 Southeast tomato disease
- Septoria leaf spot (small spots with gray centers)
- Late blight (rapidly spreading water-soaked patches — can kill plants in days)
- Blossom end rot (calcium deficiency from inconsistent watering)
- Blossom drop (above 75°F nighttime temps)
- Tomato hornworms, stink bugs, aphids

**Pro Tip:** If you want one indestructible tomato for the Southeast, plant 'Juliet'. It's a grape-type with exceptional disease resistance, it doesn't crack in rain, it produces hundreds of sweet fruit per plant, and it grows through heat that stops full-size varieties cold. It won't give you big slicing tomatoes, but it will give you tomatoes. In the Southeast, that's not nothing.

# Chapter 19: Cool-Season Vegetables A–L

These crops prefer temperatures between 40°F and 75°F and actually perform better in cool weather. Most tolerate light to moderate frost. In the Southeast, plant them in late winter/early spring and again in fall — they're your bookend crops for the two-season garden.

---

## Beets

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Easy, fast, and you eat the tops too.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Detroit Dark Red' — The standard. Deep red, sweet, reliable. 55 days.
- 'Chioggia' — Beautiful red-and-white candy-striped interior. 55 days.
- 'Golden' — Yellow flesh, doesn't stain, milder flavor. 55 days.
- 'Bull's Blood' — Grown as much for its stunning dark red leaves as for roots. 55 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow February 1–March 31 (spring), September 1–October 31 (fall)
- Upper SE: Direct sow March 1–April 30 (spring), August 15–September 30 (fall)

**Spacing:** Thin to 3–4 inches apart. Beet "seeds" are actually clusters of multiple seeds — you'll need to thin.

**Care:** Consistent moisture is essential for tender, non-woody roots. Mulch to maintain even soil moisture. Light feeder — don't over-fertilize.

**Harvest:** Pull at 2–3 inch diameter for tender baby beets, or let them grow to 3–4 inches. Beet greens are edible and nutritious — harvest outer leaves as the roots grow.

**Pro Tip:** Fall-planted beets in the Southeast are sweeter than spring-planted ones. Cold temperatures convert starches to sugars. Leave them in the ground under mulch through mild freezes for maximum sweetness.

---

## Broccoli

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Excellent fall crop; spring broccoli is trickier due to bolting.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Waltham 29' — Heat-tolerant heirloom, excellent side shoot production. 74 days.
- 'De Cicco' — Italian heirloom, many side shoots, long harvest. 65 days.
- 'Green Magic' — Heat-tolerant hybrid, early. 57 days.
- 'Belstar' — Organic grower favorite, good heat tolerance. 66 days.

**When to plant:**
- Start indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant date.
- Lower SE: Transplant February 1–March 1 (spring), September 1–October 1 (fall)
- Upper SE: Transplant March 1–April 1 (spring), August 15–September 15 (fall)

**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart, rows 30–36 inches apart.

**Care:** Heavy feeder — side-dress with nitrogen fertilizer 3 weeks after transplanting and again when heads start forming. Consistent water. Floating row cover prevents cabbageworm damage without chemicals.

**Harvest:** Cut the main head when florets are tight and before any yellow flowers show. Cut with 6 inches of stem (the stem is edible — peel it and it's excellent). After the main head, most varieties produce side shoots for 4–8 more weeks.

**Pro Tip:** For the Southeast, fall broccoli is far superior to spring broccoli. Spring broccoli must grow fast enough to produce a head before temperatures hit 80°F+ and trigger bolting. Fall broccoli grows into cooling weather and produces longer. Prioritize fall planting.

---

## Brussels Sprouts

**Southeast rating:** ★★★ — Challenging but worth it for fall/winter harvest.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Long Island Improved' — Compact, reliable. 100 days.
- 'Jade Cross' — Vigorous hybrid, good heat tolerance. 90 days.
- 'Dagan' — Disease-resistant hybrid. 100 days.

**When to plant:**
- Start indoors. These need a LONG season — 90–100 days.
- Lower SE: Start indoors June 15, transplant August 15 for November–December harvest.
- Upper SE: Start indoors June 1, transplant August 1 for October–November harvest.

**Care:** Very heavy feeder. Side-dress monthly with balanced fertilizer. Stake plants — they get top-heavy. Remove lower leaves as they yellow to improve air circulation.

**Harvest:** Pick from the bottom up as sprouts reach 1–1.5 inches diameter. Sprouts improve dramatically after frost — cold sweetens them. Don't rush the harvest.

**Pro Tip:** Brussels sprouts are a commitment crop in the Southeast. They take 90+ days, require significant space, and demand consistent care. But harvesting fresh Brussels sprouts from your garden in December — sprouts that taste nothing like the frozen bags — makes it worthwhile. Just one or two plants produce enough for most families.

---

## Cabbage

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Reliable, productive, and stores well.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Early Jersey Wakefield' — Pointed head, early, heat-tolerant. 63 days.
- 'Golden Acre' — Round, compact, good for small gardens. 65 days.
- 'Red Acre' — Red/purple, compact. 76 days.
- 'Flat Dutch' — Large heads for sauerkraut. 100 days.

**When to plant:**
- Start indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant date.
- Lower SE: Transplant February 1–March 1 (spring), September 1–October 1 (fall)
- Upper SE: Transplant March 1–April 1 (spring), August 15–September 15 (fall)

**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart, rows 30 inches apart.

**Care:** Heavy feeder. Consistent water prevents splitting. Row cover keeps cabbageworms out.

**Harvest:** When heads are firm and solid. Don't wait too long — heads split in warm weather or after heavy rain. After cutting the main head, leave the stump and lower leaves — many varieties produce 2–4 small bonus heads.

**Pro Tip:** For the Southeast, 'Early Jersey Wakefield' is the go-to spring cabbage because it matures fast (63 days) and handles heat better than most. For fall, you can grow larger, slower varieties like 'Flat Dutch' because cooling temperatures give you more time.

---

## Carrots

**Southeast rating:** ★★★ — Worth the effort, but they demand good soil.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Danvers Half Long' — Adapts to heavier soils better than most. 75 days.
- 'Nantes' types ('Bolero', 'Napoli') — Sweet, cylindrical, good in raised beds. 70 days.
- 'Chantenay' types — Short, stout, handles clay soil better. 70 days.
- 'Little Finger' — Baby carrot, great for containers and heavy soil. 55 days.

**When to plant:**
- Direct sow only (carrots don't transplant).
- Lower SE: February 1–March 15 (spring), September 1–November 1 (fall)
- Upper SE: March 1–April 15 (spring), August 15–September 30 (fall)

**Spacing:** Thin to 2 inches apart. Use pelleted seed for easier handling — carrot seed is tiny.

**Soil requirements:** Carrots need loose, rock-free soil to at least 8 inches deep. In heavy clay, grow in raised beds or choose short varieties. Any obstacle (rock, compacted soil, undecomposed organic matter) causes forking.

**Care:** Keep soil consistently moist during the 2–3 week germination period. Carrot seeds are slow and fussy germinators. Cover seeded area with a board or burlap until sprouts appear to retain moisture. Remove covering immediately at germination.

**Harvest:** Pull at any size. Baby carrots at 60 days, full-size at 70–80 days. Fall carrots left in the ground under heavy mulch sweeten through winter — cold converts starch to sugar.

**Pro Tip:** If you've never grown great carrots in Southeast soil, try growing them exclusively as a fall/winter crop in raised beds. Cool temperatures, loose raised-bed soil, and the starch-to-sugar conversion from light frost produce carrots sweeter than anything you can buy.

## Cauliflower

**Southeast rating:** ★★★ — The diva of the brassica family. Worth growing but demands precision.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Snow Crown' — Early, reliable, some heat tolerance. 50 days.
- 'Amazing' — Heat-tolerant hybrid. 68 days.
- 'Graffiti' (purple) — Doesn't need blanching, stunning color. 80 days.
- 'Cheddar' (orange) — High beta-carotene, eye-catching. 68 days.

**When to plant:**
- Start indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant date.
- Lower SE: Transplant February 1–March 1 (spring), September 1–October 1 (fall)
- Upper SE: Transplant March 1–April 1 (spring), August 15–September 15 (fall)

**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart, rows 30 inches apart.

**Care:** Cauliflower is the least heat-tolerant brassica. It bolts faster than broccoli or cabbage when temperatures exceed 80°F. Fall planting is much more reliable than spring in the Southeast. Heavy feeder — fertilize like broccoli. Blanch white varieties by tying outer leaves over the developing head to maintain white color (or grow self-blanching or colored varieties).

**Harvest:** When heads are tight and compact, 6–8 inches across. Don't wait for "just a little bigger" — they open up fast.

**Pro Tip:** 'Graffiti' (purple cauliflower) and 'Cheddar' (orange cauliflower) don't need blanching and are just as easy to grow as broccoli. If white cauliflower has frustrated you, try these colored varieties instead.

---

## Collards

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★★ — Quintessentially Southern, incredibly productive, and nearly indestructible.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Georgia Southern' (a.k.a. 'Georgia') — The classic. Large, wavy leaves. 60 days to harvest (but produces for months).
- 'Vates' — More compact, darker green, freezes well. 55 days.
- 'Champion' — Bolt-resistant, good for spring planting. 60 days.
- 'Morris Heading' — Forms a loose head, tender leaves. 70 days.
- 'Green Glaze' — Glossy leaves that aphids have trouble gripping. Heirloom, insect-resistant. 75 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Transplant or direct sow February 1–March 15 (spring), August 1–October 15 (fall)
- Upper SE: March 1–April 15 (spring), August 1–September 15 (fall)
- Can also be direct-sown — collards are tough enough to handle it.

**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart, rows 36 inches apart. These plants get LARGE.

**Care:** Collards are the toughest green in the garden. They tolerate heat that wilts lettuce, cold that kills Swiss chard, and periods of drought that would finish most crops. Fertilize monthly during active growth. Water during dry spells.

**Harvest:** Harvest outer leaves from the bottom of the plant, leaving the growing point (top center) to continue producing. A single collard plant harvested this way produces for 4–8 months. Fall-planted collards can overwinter in the Lower Southeast and produce until spring bolt.

**Frost tolerance:** Collards tolerate temperatures down to about 15°F. Frost dramatically improves their flavor — sweetening the leaves the same way frost sweetens Brussels sprouts and kale. Many Southeast gardeners deliberately wait until after the first frost to begin harvest.

**Common problems:** Cabbageworms, cabbage loopers, aphids. Row cover or Bt spray. Harlequin bugs. That's about it.

**Pro Tip:** 'Green Glaze' collards are a remarkable Southeast heirloom. The glossy, wax-like leaf surface makes it genuinely harder for aphids and whiteflies to grip and feed. It's a built-in insect resistance trait developed over generations of Southern growing. If pests on your collards bother you, try this variety.

## Garlic

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Easy to grow, but you must choose the right type for our climate.

**The critical distinction:** There are two types of garlic — hardneck and softneck. The Southeast grows softneck garlic. Hardneck garlic needs a sustained cold period (below 40°F for 6+ weeks) that most of the Southeast doesn't reliably provide. Exception: Upper Southeast gardeners in zones 6b–7a can grow hardneck varieties.

**Softneck Varieties:**
- 'Inchelium Red' — Large, mild, adaptable. Stores well.
- 'California Early' — Reliable, early maturity. Good for the Southeast.
- 'Silver White' — Classic softneck, great for braiding.
- 'Thermadrone' — Heat-tolerant softneck, specifically bred for warm climates.

**Hardneck Varieties (Upper Southeast only):**
- 'Music' — Large cloves, robust flavor.
- 'German Extra Hardy' — Cold-hardy, strong flavor.
- 'Chesnok Red' — Best baking garlic.

**When to plant:** Fall. This is the single most important thing to know about garlic.
- Lower SE: October 15–November 30
- Upper SE: October 1–November 15

**Planting:** Break bulbs into individual cloves (don't peel). Plant pointed end up, 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart in rows 12 inches apart. Mulch immediately with 3–4 inches of straw.

**Care:** Garlic is incredibly low-maintenance. Water during dry winter and spring spells. Fertilize with nitrogen in late February when growth resumes. Stop watering 2 weeks before harvest.

**Harvest:** Late May to mid-June when lower leaves are brown but 5–6 green leaves remain. Don't wait until all leaves are brown — you need some green leaves for the bulb wrapper to stay intact. Dig (don't pull) — stems break easily.

**Curing:** Hang in a warm, dry, airy spot for 2–4 weeks. After curing, trim roots and stems (leave 1 inch of stem on softneck for braiding if desired). Store at room temperature. Properly cured softneck garlic stores 6–9 months.

**Pro Tip:** Don't buy garlic for planting from the grocery store. It's often treated with sprout inhibitor and may be Chinese origin (poorly adapted to our climate). Buy "seed garlic" from reputable sources: Filaree Garlic Farm, Territorial Seed Company, or Southern Exposure Seed Exchange. It's more expensive ($12–15/lb) but each bulb produces 8–12 new bulbs.

## Kale

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — The trendy green that actually earns its reputation.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Vates Dwarf Blue Curled' — Compact, cold-hardy, productive. 55 days.
- 'Lacinato' (Dinosaur/Tuscan kale) — Dark, bumpy leaves, sweeter than curly types. 60 days.
- 'Red Russian' — Tender, mild, beautiful purple-red stems. 50 days.
- 'Winterbor' — Extremely cold-hardy curly type. 60 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow or transplant February 1–March 15 (spring), August 15–October 15 (fall)
- Upper SE: March 1–April 15 (spring), August 1–September 15 (fall)

**Spacing:** 18 inches apart, rows 24–30 inches apart.

**Care:** Similar to collards but slightly less heat-tolerant. Kale handles frost even better than collards — some varieties survive single-digit temperatures. Fertilize monthly, water during dry spells.

**Harvest:** Same as collards — pick outer leaves, leave the growing center. Baby kale leaves (3–4 inches) are tenderest for salads. Mature leaves are better cooked.

**Pro Tip:** Kale and collards are essentially the same plant (both are *Brassica oleracea* var. *acephala*). If you can grow collards, you can grow kale. Collards are more heat-tolerant; kale is more cold-tolerant. Plant collards for your summer greens and kale for winter.

## Lettuce

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Essential, but timing is everything.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Black Seeded Simpson' (leaf) — Fast, forgiving, bolt-resistant. 45 days.
- 'Buttercrunch' (butterhead) — Tender, heat-tolerant. 55 days.
- 'Jericho' (romaine) — Bred for hot climates, slow to bolt. 60 days.
- 'Muir' (leaf) — Excellent heat tolerance, long standing. 55 days.
- 'Red Sails' (leaf) — Red-tinged, bolt-resistant. 45 days.
- 'Winter Density' (romaine) — Cold-hardy, overwinters in Lower SE. 60 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow September 15–February 28 (fall/winter/early spring). Spring lettuce bolts by May.
- Upper SE: Direct sow March 1–April 30 (spring), September 1–October 15 (fall)

**Spacing:** Leaf types: 6–8 inches. Head types: 10–12 inches. Or broadcast seed and harvest as baby greens at 3–4 inches tall.

**Care:** Light feeder. Keep soil consistently moist (lettuce is shallow-rooted and dries out fast). Mulch to cool soil.

**The bolting problem:** Lettuce bolts (sends up a flower stalk and turns bitter) when temperatures exceed 80°F consistently or when day length increases in spring. Solutions:
1. Grow bolt-resistant varieties ('Jericho', 'Muir').
2. Provide afternoon shade in spring.
3. Focus on fall/winter lettuce — it's a much more reliable season in the Southeast.
4. Harvest as baby greens before bolting can occur.

**Pro Tip:** In the Lower Southeast (zones 8b–9a), lettuce is fundamentally a fall/winter crop, not a spring crop. Plant from October through February under row cover, and harvest fresh salad greens all winter long. This is the Southeast advantage that Northern gardeners envy.

# Chapter 20: Cool-Season Vegetables M–Z

## Mustard Greens

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Fast, spicy, and perfectly suited to Southern cooking.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Southern Giant Curled' — The classic, large curly leaves with peppery bite. 45 days.
- 'Florida Broadleaf' — Large, less curly, milder. 50 days.
- 'Tendergreen' (mustard spinach) — Smooth leaves, mild. 40 days.
- 'Red Giant' — Beautiful red-purple leaves, spicy. 45 days.
- 'Mizuna' — Japanese mustard, mild, cut-and-come-again. 40 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow September 15–March 1 (fall through early spring).
- Upper SE: Direct sow March 1–April 15 (spring), August 15–October 1 (fall)

**Spacing:** 6–12 inches apart, or broadcast thickly for baby greens.

**Care:** Mustard greens practically grow themselves. They're fast, vigorous, and unfussy. Keep soil moist for best leaf quality. Side-dress with nitrogen once if growth slows.

**Harvesting:** Cut outer leaves at 6–8 inches for continuous harvest, or harvest the whole plant at maturity. In the Southeast, mustard often self-sows — you'll have volunteer patches for years. Consider that a feature, not a bug.

**Pro Tip:** Mustard greens are your gateway to Asian greens. Once you realize how easy 'Mizuna' and 'Tendergreen' are, you'll want to try tatsoi, bok choy, and komatsuna. They all grow the same way — fast, cool-season, cut-and-come-again. Your fall garden can look like a Tokyo market stall.

---

## Onions

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — Essential, but you MUST choose short-day varieties.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Texas 1015Y' — Sweet, mild, large. The gold standard for Southern onions.
- 'Granex' (Vidalia type) — Sweet and famous. Best in zones 7b–8b.
- 'Red Burgundy' — Short-day red, mild and sweet. Beautiful in salads.
- 'Candy' (intermediate day) — Works in upper SE zones 7a–7b.
- 'Evergreen White Bunching' — Perennial scallion, harvest year-round.

**The day-length thing (this matters!):** Onions form bulbs in response to day length, not size or age. Short-day varieties bulb when day length hits 10–12 hours — perfect for Southern latitudes. Long-day varieties need 14–16 hours and will NEVER bulb in the Southeast. If you plant 'Walla Walla' or 'Ailsa Craig,' you'll get lovely green tops and zero bulbs. Every year, somebody does this. Don't be that person.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Set out transplants or sets October 15–December 15. Yes, fall. They overwinter and bulb in spring.
- Upper SE: Set out transplants February 1–March 15.

**Spacing:** 4–6 inches for full-size bulbs. 2 inches for scallions/green onions.

**Care:** Consistent water and nitrogen through winter/spring. Stop watering when tops begin to fall over — they're telling you they're done.

**Harvesting:** When 50% of tops have flopped, pull them and cure in a shaded, dry area for 2–3 weeks. Don't braid until fully cured. Sweet short-day onions don't store as long as pungent storage types — eat within 1–3 months.

**Pro Tip:** Grow onion sets and transplants, not seed (unless you start seed 8–10 weeks early indoors). Sets establish faster and handle winter weather better. And grow way more bunching onions than you think you need. You always need more scallions.

---

## Peas

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★ — One of the earliest spring harvests, and one of the most satisfying.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Sugar Snap' — The original edible-pod snap pea. 60 days.
- 'Super Sugar Snap' — Improved disease resistance. 65 days.
- 'Oregon Sugar Pod II' — Snow pea, flat edible pods. 65 days.
- 'Green Arrow' — English shelling pea, prolific. 68 days.
- 'Wando' — Heat-tolerant shelling pea. Best for upper SE spring planting. 68 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow January 15–February 28. Fall planting October 15–November 15 also works.
- Upper SE: Direct sow February 15–March 31. Peas tolerate frost and light freezes.

**Spacing:** 2–3 inches apart in rows, or in a wide band along a trellis.

**Support:** Bush types (under 3 feet) can manage without support but do better with it. Climbing types need a 5–6 foot trellis, fence, or netting.

**Care:** Peas are legumes — they fix their own nitrogen. Don't fertilize with nitrogen or you'll get all vine and no peas. Inoculate seed with rhizobium bacteria if planting in soil that hasn't grown peas before.

**The heat wall:** Peas stop producing when temperatures consistently exceed 80°F. In the Lower Southeast, that's often late April. In the Upper Southeast, you might get through May. Either way, peas are a sprint, not a marathon. Get them in the ground as early as possible.

**Pro Tip:** When peas are done, don't pull the plants — cut them at the soil line and leave the roots. Those nitrogen-fixing nodules will feed whatever you plant next. Follow peas with a heavy feeder like tomatoes or squash. That's free fertilizer, folks.

---

## Radishes

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★★ — The 25-day confidence booster every gardener needs.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Cherry Belle' — Classic red globe, 22 days. Basically instant gratification.
- 'French Breakfast' — Oblong, mild. 28 days.
- 'Watermelon' — Green outside, pink inside. 55 days (worth the wait).
- 'Daikon' (fall only) — Long white root, 60 days. Plant September–October.
- 'Easter Egg' — Mix of colors, fun for kids and salads. 25 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow September through March. Avoid summer entirely.
- Upper SE: Direct sow March 1–May 1 (spring), September 1–October 15 (fall)

**Spacing:** 1–2 inches apart. Thin to 2 inches.

**Care:** Water consistently. That's it. Radishes are the golden retrievers of the vegetable world — happy, eager, and almost impossible to disappoint.

**The hot/pithy problem:** Radishes that taste like tiny fireballs or have pithy, hollow centers were either stressed by heat, left in the ground too long, or under-watered. Harvest promptly, water consistently, and grow them in cool weather. Problem solved.

**Pro Tip:** Radishes are the perfect inter-crop. Sow them between rows of slow-growing crops like carrots, onions, or transplants. They'll be harvested before the main crop needs the space. They also mark rows — if you direct-sow carrots (which take forever to germinate), mix in a few radish seeds. The radishes pop up in days, marking where your carrot row is.

---

## Spinach

**Southeast rating:** ★★★ — Doable but demanding. Consider alternatives.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Bloomsdale Long Standing' — Savoy (crinkly) type, best bolt resistance. 48 days.
- 'Space' — Smooth leaf, excellent bolt resistance, good for Southeast. 40 days.
- 'Tyee' — Semi-savoy, vigorous. 45 days.
- 'Malabar Spinach' — NOT true spinach, but a heat-loving tropical vine that tastes similar. Grows all summer. This is the one to grow for "spinach" in Southeast summers.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow October 1–February 1. True spinach is strictly a fall/winter crop.
- Upper SE: Direct sow September 15–October 15 (fall), February 15–March 15 (spring)

**Spacing:** 4–6 inches.

**The honest truth:** True spinach is fussy in the Southeast. It bolts at the first warm spell, hates our long days, and is generally the vegetable equivalent of a high-maintenance friend. Grow it in fall/winter when conditions are ideal, but for warm-season greens, grow Malabar spinach, Swiss chard, or New Zealand spinach instead. Your blood pressure will thank you.

**Pro Tip:** If you love spinach and live in the Lower Southeast, try growing it under shade cloth (30–40%) in fall and winter. The reduced light and cooler temperatures extend the harvest significantly. Also, harvest frequently — cutting the outer leaves keeps the plant vegetative longer.

---

## Turnips

**Southeast rating:** ★★★★★ — Dual-purpose Southern staple. Greens AND roots.

**Varieties for the Southeast:**
- 'Purple Top White Globe' — The classic, 55 days. Good roots and good greens.
- 'Seven Top' — Grown primarily for greens (roots are small). 45 days for greens.
- 'Hakurei' — Japanese salad turnip, tender and sweet raw. 38 days.
- 'Shogoin' — Large, smooth, excellent greens. 50 days.

**When to plant:**
- Lower SE: Direct sow September 1–March 1.
- Upper SE: Direct sow March 1–April 30 (spring), August 15–October 1 (fall)

**Spacing:** 4–6 inches for roots. 2–3 inches (or broadcast) for greens only.

**Care:** Like radishes, turnips are fast and forgiving. Keep watered for best root quality. Heavy mulch prevents the roots from getting woody.

**Harvesting:** Pull roots at 2–3 inches diameter for best flavor and texture. Larger roots get woody and strong-flavored. For greens, harvest outer leaves at 4–6 inches or cut the whole plant at 6–8 inches.

**Pro Tip:** 'Seven Top' turnip is a Southern tradition for a reason — it produces enormous amounts of tender greens with minimal effort. If you only want turnip greens (and let's be honest, that's what most Southerners are after), 'Seven Top' is the way. Broadcast seed thickly in September and you'll be swimming in greens by November.

---

*That concludes our vegetable profiles. We couldn't cover every vegetable that grows in the Southeast — notable mentions include beets, Swiss chard, carrots, celery, kohlrabi, leeks, parsnips, rutabagas, and more. If it grows in cool weather, it probably does great in a Southeast fall/winter garden. If it grows in heat, well, welcome home. Experiment freely. The worst that happens is you get compost.*

# Part IV: Keeping It All Alive

# Chapter 21: Pest & Disease Management for the Southeast

## The Southeast Pest Reality Check

Let's not sugarcoat it: the Southeast's warm, humid climate is an all-you-can-eat buffet for insects and diseases. The same conditions that let you grow tomatoes eight months a year also let fungal spores throw a nonstop pool party. The same mild winters that mean you can garden in January also mean pest populations never fully crash.

But here's the good news: you don't need to win the war. You just need to manage it. Every experienced Southeast gardener has made peace with some level of pest and disease pressure. A few aphids aren't an emergency. A little powdery mildew isn't the apocalypse. Your goal isn't a perfect garden — it's a productive one.

## The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach

IPM is a fancy way of saying "use common sense before you reach for the spray bottle." The hierarchy goes like this:

### 1. Prevention (The Best Medicine)

**Healthy soil = healthy plants = fewer problems.** Plants growing in well-amended, biologically active soil with proper nutrition resist pests and diseases far better than stressed plants in depleted soil. This is where all that composting pays off.

**Choose resistant varieties.** When a tomato variety says "VFN" after its name, that means it resists Verticillium, Fusarium, and Nematodes. In the Southeast, those letters are worth more than gold. Always choose disease-resistant varieties when available.

**Proper spacing and airflow.** Fungal diseases need moisture to spread. Crowded plants with poor airflow stay wet longer. Give plants room to breathe.

**Water the soil, not the leaves.** Drip irrigation or soaker hoses keep foliage dry, which dramatically reduces fungal disease. Overhead watering in the evening is basically an engraved invitation for every fungus in the zip code.

**Rotate crops.** Don't plant the same family in the same spot year after year. Soil-borne diseases and pest populations build up. (More on rotation in the next chapter.)

**Keep it clean.** Remove diseased plant material promptly. Don't compost plants with serious disease — bag them and trash them.

### 2. Physical & Mechanical Controls

**Row covers** — Lightweight fabric draped over crops physically excludes insects. Excellent for brassicas (against cabbage moths), squash (against vine borers early on), and leafy greens. The single best pest-prevention tool you can buy.

**Hand-picking** — Glamorous? No. Effective? Absolutely. For hornworms, squash bugs, and harlequin bugs, hand-picking is often the most effective control. Drop them in a bucket of soapy water. Morning is best when they're sluggish.

**Trap crops** — Plant something pests prefer more than your main crop. Blue Hubbard squash planted near your summer squash will attract squash vine borers like a magnet, sparing your zucchini. Nasturtiums attract aphids away from vegetables.

**Yellow sticky traps** — Good for monitoring whiteflies, fungus gnats, and aphids. They tell you what's flying around so you can respond before populations explode.

### 3. Biological Controls

**Encourage beneficial insects.** Ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps, and predatory beetles eat enormous numbers of pest insects. Plant flowers among your vegetables — zinnias, marigolds, sunflowers, sweet alyssum, dill, and fennel all attract beneficials. Stop spraying broad-spectrum pesticides that kill everything.

**Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis)** — A naturally occurring soil bacterium that kills caterpillars when they eat it. Extremely effective against cabbage worms, hornworms, and corn earworms. It's specific to caterpillars and doesn't harm beneficials, bees, or humans. Apply every 7–10 days or after rain.

**Beneficial nematodes** — Applied to soil, these microscopic worms attack soil-dwelling pest larvae including grubs, squash vine borer pupae, and cutworms. Apply in fall for best results.

**Neem oil** — Extracted from neem tree seeds. Works as a repellent, feeding deterrent, and disrupts insect development. Effective against a wide range of soft-bodied insects. Apply in evening (it can burn foliage in hot sun and harms bees when wet).

### 4. Chemical Controls (Last Resort)

If you need to spray, start with the least toxic option:

- **Insecticidal soap** — Effective on soft-bodied insects (aphids, whiteflies, spider mites). Must contact the insect directly. No residual activity.
- **Spinosad** — Derived from soil bacteria. Effective against caterpillars, thrips, beetles. Somewhat toxic to bees when wet — apply in evening.
- **Copper fungicide** — Effective preventive against bacterial and fungal diseases (early blight, bacterial spot). Apply BEFORE disease appears. Can build up in soil — use sparingly.
- **Sulfur** — Effective against powdery mildew and some other fungi. Don't use within 2 weeks of oil sprays.

**What to avoid:** Broad-spectrum synthetic pesticides (carbaryl/Sevin, malathion, pyrethroids) kill everything — pests, beneficials, pollinators. You'll create a worse problem long-term as pest populations rebound without their natural predators.

## The Southeast's Most Wanted: Common Pests

### Squash Vine Borer
**The problem:** A moth lays eggs at the base of squash stems. Larvae bore inside and eat the plant from within. One day your squash looks fine; the next day it collapses like a deflated balloon.

**Controls:**
- Cover plants with row cover until flowering (then remove for pollination)
- Wrap stem bases with aluminum foil or nylon stocking
- Plant Blue Hubbard squash as a trap crop
- Inject Bt into stems with a syringe if you catch infestation early
- Plant moschata-type squash (butternut) — they're more resistant than maxima or pepo types
- Fall planting (July–August) often avoids peak borer season

### Tomato Hornworm
**The problem:** Enormous green caterpillars that can defoliate a tomato plant seemingly overnight. They're masters of camouflage despite being the size of your finger.

**Controls:**
- Hand-pick (check undersides of leaves at dawn or dusk)
- Bt spray every 7–10 days
- If you see a hornworm covered in white cocoons, LEAVE IT — those are parasitic wasp pupae that will hatch and kill more hornworms. That's nature doing your pest control for free.

### Aphids
**The problem:** Tiny soft-bodied insects that cluster on new growth, sucking sap and excreting honeydew (which attracts sooty mold). They multiply astronomically fast.

**Controls:**
- Strong blast of water from the hose (seriously, this works great)
- Ladybugs and lacewings eat hundreds per day
- Insecticidal soap for heavy infestations
- Healthy plants outgrow moderate aphid damage

### Stink Bugs & Leaf-Footed Bugs
**The problem:** Shield-shaped bugs that pierce fruits (especially tomatoes and beans) and inject saliva, causing pale, corky spots inside the fruit.

**Controls:**
- Hand-pick into soapy water (morning when they're slow)
- Kaolin clay spray (Surround) deters feeding
- Trap crops: sunflowers and sorghum attract them
- Row covers on fruiting crops (pollination becomes your job)

### Flea Beetles
**The problem:** Tiny black beetles that pepper leaves with hundreds of tiny holes, giving foliage a "shotgun blast" appearance. Especially damaging to young brassicas and eggplant.

**Controls:**
- Row covers (the best solution)
- Kaolin clay spray
- Established plants outgrow damage — protect transplants for the first 3–4 weeks

### Cabbage Worms & Loopers
**The problem:** Green caterpillars (larvae of white cabbage moths and brown moths) that eat holes in brassica leaves.

**Controls:**
- Bt spray (extremely effective)
- Row covers (prevents moths from laying eggs)
- Hand-pick

### Root-Knot Nematodes
**The problem:** Microscopic worms in the soil that infect roots, causing swollen galls that prevent nutrient uptake. Plants wilt, yellow, and decline. Extremely common in sandy Southern soils.

**Controls:**
- Plant resistant varieties (the "N" in VFN)
- Solarize soil in summer (clear plastic for 6–8 weeks)
- Grow 'Elbon' cereal rye as a winter cover crop (suppresses nematodes)
- French marigolds (*Tagetes patula*) planted densely and tilled in suppress nematode populations
- Add heavy organic matter — healthy soil biology competes with nematodes

## The Southeast's Worst Diseases

### Early Blight (*Alternaria solani*)
**Crops affected:** Tomatoes, potatoes
**Symptoms:** Brown spots with concentric rings (target pattern) on lower leaves, progressing upward.
**Management:** Mulch heavily (prevents soil splash), prune lower leaves, improve airflow, apply copper fungicide preventively. Choose resistant varieties. Remove and destroy affected leaves.

### Late Blight (*Phytophthora infestans*)
**Crops affected:** Tomatoes, potatoes
**Symptoms:** Dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems, white fuzzy growth underneath. Spreads rapidly in cool, wet weather.
**Management:** This is the one that causes genuine panic. It can destroy an entire crop in days. Remove affected plants IMMEDIATELY (bag and trash, don't compost). Copper fungicide preventively. Monitor late-blight tracking websites during spring.

### Bacterial Wilt (*Ralstonia solanacearum*)
**Crops affected:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant
**Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of the entire plant on a hot day, doesn't recover overnight. Cut the stem — if you see brown streaks inside, it's bacterial wilt.
**Management:** No cure. Remove affected plants and surrounding soil. Don't plant solanaceous crops in that spot for 3–5 years. Grafted tomatoes on resistant rootstock are the best prevention.

### Downy Mildew
**Crops affected:** Cucurbits (especially cucumbers), basil, lettuce
**Symptoms:** Yellow angular spots on leaf tops, purple-gray fuzz underneath.
**Management:** Resistant varieties, airflow, avoid overhead watering. Copper fungicide preventively. For basil, grow 'Amazel' or 'Prospera' varieties bred for downy mildew resistance.

### Powdery Mildew
**Crops affected:** Squash, cucumbers, melons, peas, beans
**Symptoms:** White powdery coating on leaves. Unlike most fungal diseases, powdery mildew thrives in DRY conditions with moderate temperatures.
**Management:** Resistant varieties, sulfur spray, potassium bicarbonate spray (1 tablespoon per gallon of water), neem oil. Adequate spacing and airflow.

### Southern Blight (*Sclerotium rolfsii*)
**Crops affected:** Almost everything — tomatoes, peppers, beans, carrots, and dozens more
**Symptoms:** White fungal mat at the soil line, plant wilts and dies. Small tan "mustard seed" sclerotia visible in the fungal mat.
**Management:** Deep-turn soil to bury sclerotia, rotate crops, avoid burying stems, keep mulch a few inches away from stems. Solarize heavily affected areas. This is a Southeast specialty — the fungus loves our heat and humidity.

# Chapter 22: Companion Planting & Crop Rotation

## Companion Planting: Science vs. Folklore

Let's be honest: a lot of companion planting advice is folklore passed down through gardening books that cite other gardening books that cite nothing at all. "Plant basil next to tomatoes for better flavor!" Sounds great. The evidence? Thin.

But some companion planting principles ARE well-supported:

### What Actually Works

**Trap cropping** — Planting something pests prefer to lure them away from your main crop. Blue Hubbard squash for vine borers, nasturtiums for aphids, and radishes for flea beetles are all well-documented.

**Beneficial insect habitat** — Interplanting flowers and herbs among vegetables attracts and supports predatory and parasitic insects. This is not folklore — it's established ecological science. Dill, fennel, sweet alyssum, yarrow, and members of the daisy family are especially valuable.

**Nitrogen fixation** — Legumes (beans, peas, clover, vetch) fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules. Growing legumes before or alongside heavy feeders demonstrably improves soil fertility.

**Allelopathy** — Some plants release chemicals that inhibit growth of other plants. Black walnut trees produce juglone, which kills tomatoes and many other vegetables. This is real and well-documented. Don't garden under walnut trees.

**Physical synergy** — The "Three Sisters" (corn, beans, squash) is a genuine companion planting success: corn provides a trellis for beans, beans fix nitrogen for corn, and squash shades the ground. It works because of physical structure and nutrient cycling, not mystical plant friendships.

### What's Dubious

**Flavor improvement** — "Basil improves tomato flavor." There's no reliable evidence for this. They taste great TOGETHER in a dish, which might be where the myth started.

**Pest repellent by proximity** — "Marigolds repel everything." French marigolds (*Tagetes patula*) do suppress root-knot nematodes when grown densely and tilled in. They do NOT significantly repel above-ground insects just by being nearby. A few marigolds scattered in your garden are pretty but aren't a pest management strategy.

### Practical Companion Planting for the Southeast

Instead of rigid "plant this next to that" charts, think in principles:

1. **Diversify** — Monocultures attract pests. Mixed plantings confuse them.
2. **Include flowers** — Every bed should have some flowering plants for beneficial insects.
3. **Stack layers** — Tall crops shade short crops. Use vertical space.
4. **Time-share** — Interplant fast crops (radishes, lettuce) with slow crops (tomatoes, peppers).
5. **Follow feeders with fixers** — Plant beans after corn. Plant cover crops after heavy harvests.

## Crop Rotation: This One Actually Matters

If companion planting is the fun but debatable part, crop rotation is the boring but essential part. Rotating crops — not planting the same plant family in the same spot year after year — is one of the most effective tools for managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and nutrient depletion.

### The Plant Families (Know These)

| Family | Members | Common Problems |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Solanaceae | Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes | Blight, bacterial wilt, nematodes |
| Cucurbitaceae | Squash, cucumbers, melons, gourds | Powdery mildew, vine borers, bacterial wilt |
| Brassicaceae | Cabbage, broccoli, kale, collards, turnips, radishes | Clubroot, black rot, cabbage worms |
| Fabaceae | Beans, peas, cowpeas | Root rot, nitrogen fixation (benefit!) |
| Allium | Onions, garlic, leeks | Minimal disease issues (great rotation crop) |
| Amaranthaceae | Beets, Swiss chard, spinach | Leaf miners |

### Simple 4-Year Rotation

Don't overthink this. A basic 4-bed rotation works great:

**Year 1:** Fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers)
**Year 2:** Legumes (beans, peas, cowpeas) + alliums (onions, garlic)
**Year 3:** Brassicas (broccoli, cabbage, kale, collards)
**Year 4:** Root crops (carrots, beets, turnips) + leafy greens

Then start over. Each group follows the one that benefits it most. Legumes add nitrogen for the brassicas that follow. Brassicas clean up before root crops. Fruiting crops get the freshly nitrogen-enriched bed.

### Southeast-Specific Rotation Tips

- **Nematode-prone soils:** Never follow tomatoes with tomatoes. Ever. Alternate with brassicas, alliums, or a cereal rye cover crop.
- **Southern blight zones:** Avoid planting susceptible crops (tomatoes, peppers, beans) in the same spot for at least 3 years after an outbreak.
- **Summer cover crops between rotations:** When a bed finishes in spring, plant a summer cover crop (cowpeas, buckwheat, sorghum-sudangrass) rather than leaving it fallow. Bare soil in a Southeast summer is an invitation for weeds, erosion, and nutrient loss.
- **Winter cover crops:** After fall harvest, plant 'Elbon' cereal rye, crimson clover, or Austrian winter peas. These suppress weeds, prevent erosion, add organic matter, and (in the case of clover and peas) fix nitrogen. Terminate in spring 2–3 weeks before planting.

**The honest truth about rotation in small gardens:** If you've got four raised beds, perfect rotation is doable. If you've got one bed and you want tomatoes every year... just amend heavily with compost, choose resistant varieties, and do the best you can. Imperfect rotation is better than none, and heavy composting compensates for a lot of sins.

# Part V: Extending the Harvest

# Chapter 23: Season Extension in the Southeast

## Wait — Why Do We Need Season Extension?

Good question. The Southeast already has an incredibly long growing season. Zones 8–9 can grow something year-round without any special equipment. So why talk about season extension?

Because the shoulder seasons — early spring and late fall — are when the magic happens. A little frost protection extends your tomato harvest into December. A simple row cover lets you plant lettuce in November that you're eating in January. Season extension in the Southeast isn't about fighting brutal winters; it's about squeezing every last week out of an already generous climate.

And here's the secret: **season extension in the Southeast is cheap and easy.** We're not talking heated greenhouses and triple-layer polycarbonate. We're talking bedsheets and row cover fabric.

## The Tools of Season Extension

### Row Cover (Floating or Supported)

**What it is:** Lightweight spun-bonded fabric (like Agribon or Reemay) that drapes over plants, allowing light and water through while trapping a few degrees of warmth and excluding insects.

**Temperature protection:**
- Lightweight (AG-19): 2–4°F protection. Mainly for insect exclusion.
- Medium (AG-30): 4–6°F protection. Good for light frost.
- Heavy (AG-50): 6–8°F protection. For hard frost and extended cold snaps.

**How to use it:** Drape directly over plants ("floating") or over wire hoops for a supported mini-tunnel. Secure edges with sandbags, rocks, or earth staples. In the Southeast, medium-weight row cover gets you through 90% of cold events.

**Southeast advantage:** Because our cold snaps are usually brief (2–5 days), even a simple row cover can protect crops that would be killed in longer, deeper cold. A 28°F night with row cover becomes a 34°F night under the fabric. That's the difference between dead tomatoes and more salsa.

### Cold Frames

**What they are:** Bottomless boxes with a transparent lid (glass or polycarbonate). Basically a mini-greenhouse sitting on the ground.

**Why they're great for the Southeast:** A cold frame in zones 7b–8b lets you grow lettuce, spinach, and other greens all winter with zero energy input. The solar gain during our sunny winter days keeps plants growing even when nighttime temps dip into the 20s.

**DIY version:** A wooden frame made from 2x12 lumber, sloped from back (12 inches) to front (8 inches), topped with an old glass window or clear polycarbonate sheet. Total cost: $20–$40. You can build one in an afternoon.

**Management:** Open the lid on sunny days above 50°F to prevent overheating. Close before sunset to trap warmth. Automated cold-frame openers (solar-powered wax cylinders) cost about $30 and save you from remembering every day.

### Low Tunnels (Quick Hoops)

**What they are:** Wire or PVC hoops over a bed, covered with plastic or row cover, creating a tunnel 2–3 feet high.

**Why they're perfect for the Southeast:** Cheap, fast to build, and effective. Ten-foot lengths of 9-gauge wire bent into hoops, spaced every 4 feet along a bed, covered with 6-mil greenhouse plastic or heavy row cover. You can build a 20-foot tunnel for under $30 in materials.

**Temperature boost:** 8–15°F above ambient with plastic (more on sunny days). Combined with row cover underneath the plastic, you can protect crops down into the low teens.

**Ventilation is critical:** On sunny Southeast winter days, an unvented low tunnel can exceed 100°F inside. Open the ends or push up the sides for airflow when daytime temps are above 50°F.

### Shade Cloth

**Wait — shade cloth is season extension?** In the Southeast, absolutely. Our season-ender for cool-season crops isn't cold — it's heat. A 30–40% shade cloth over lettuce, spinach, and peas extends their productive life by 2–4 weeks in spring and lets you start them 2–3 weeks earlier in fall. That's a month of extra production from a $15 piece of shade cloth.

### Mulch (The Unsung Hero)

Heavy mulch moderates soil temperature in both directions — keeping it cooler in summer heat and warmer during winter cold snaps. In winter, mulched garden beds stay warmer than bare soil, protecting root systems and overwintering crops. In summer, mulch keeps soil cool enough for fall-planted transplants to establish even in August heat.

## Season Extension Calendar for the Southeast

**Upper Southeast (Zones 7a–7b):**
- February: Start warm-season transplants indoors under lights
- March: Plant cool-season crops under row cover; harden off transplants
- April: Transplant warm-season crops with row cover ready for late frost
- October: Row cover extends warm-season crops 2–4 weeks past first frost
- November–February: Cold frames and low tunnels for winter greens

**Lower Southeast (Zones 8a–9a):**
- September: Shade cloth for fall lettuce and brassica transplants
- October–November: Plant cool-season crops for winter production
- December–February: Row cover or low tunnels for frost protection during cold snaps
- March: Remove protection as temperatures warm; start transitioning to warm-season crops
- July–August: Shade cloth for establishing fall transplants in extreme heat

**The bottom line:** With $50 worth of row cover and a few wire hoops, you can harvest fresh vegetables every single month of the year in the Southeast. No heating, no electricity, no complicated infrastructure. Just a little fabric and the South's generous sun. That's a deal that's hard to beat.

# Chapter 25: Glossary

**Allelopathy** — The chemical inhibition of one plant's growth by another. Black walnut trees are the poster child.

**Amendments** — Materials added to soil to improve its properties. Compost, lime, sulfur, gypsum, perlite, and aged manure are common amendments.

**Annual** — A plant that completes its life cycle (germination to seed) in one growing season. Most vegetables are annuals.

**Biennial** — A plant that takes two years to complete its life cycle. Onions, carrots, and parsley are biennials (they flower and seed in their second year).

**Bolt** — When a plant prematurely sends up a flower stalk, usually in response to heat or day length. Lettuce, spinach, cilantro, and radishes are notorious bolters.

**Brix** — A measure of sugar content in fruit. Higher brix generally means better flavor. Healthy soil tends to produce higher-brix produce.

**Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)** — A measure of soil's ability to hold and exchange nutrients. Higher CEC = more fertile soil. Clay and organic matter have high CEC; sand has low CEC.

**Cold frame** — A bottomless box with a transparent lid used to protect plants from cold and extend the growing season.

**Compost** — Decomposed organic matter used as a soil amendment. Often called "black gold" by gardeners, which tells you everything about its value.

**Cover crop** — A crop grown primarily to benefit the soil rather than for harvest. Clover, rye, and vetch are common cover crops.

**Cultivar** — A cultivated variety of a plant selected for specific desirable traits. 'Better Boy' is a cultivar of tomato.

**Damping off** — A fungal disease that kills seedlings at the soil line. Caused by too-wet, too-cool conditions and poor air circulation.

**Days to maturity** — The number of days from transplanting (for transplanted crops) or seeding (for direct-sown crops) to first expected harvest.

**Determinate** — A tomato growth type that reaches a set size, fruits heavily over 2–3 weeks, then declines. Good for canning.

**Direct sow** — Planting seeds directly in the garden where they'll grow, rather than starting them indoors and transplanting.

**Drip irrigation** — A water delivery system using emitters that drip water slowly directly to the root zone. Efficient and reduces foliar disease.

**Extension service** — Your state's Cooperative Extension Service, affiliated with the land-grant university. Free, science-based advice. Your tax dollars at work — actually use them.

**Fertilizer numbers (N-P-K)** — The three numbers on fertilizer bags represent Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium by percentage of weight. 10-10-10 is 10% each.

**Frost date** — The average date of the last spring frost or first fall frost for your area. Key for planting timing.

**Grafted plants** — Plants with the top portion (scion) of one variety attached to the root system (rootstock) of another. Grafted tomatoes combine great flavor with disease-resistant roots.

**Hardening off** — Gradually exposing indoor-grown seedlings to outdoor conditions over 7–10 days before transplanting.

**Heirloom** — An open-pollinated variety that has been passed down for generations (generally 50+ years). Not a hybrid.

**Hybrid (F1)** — A plant resulting from a controlled cross between two specific parent varieties. Often shows superior vigor and disease resistance. Seeds saved from hybrids won't come true.

**Indeterminate** — A tomato growth type that continues growing and producing fruit until killed by frost or disease. Needs support.

**Inoculant** — Beneficial bacteria (especially rhizobium for legumes) applied to seeds to improve nitrogen fixation.

**Microclimate** — A small area with different climatic conditions than its surroundings. A south-facing wall, a low frost pocket, or the sheltered side of a building all create microclimates.

**Mulch** — Material laid over the soil surface to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, moderate temperature, and (for organic mulch) add organic matter as it decomposes.

**Nematode** — Microscopic roundworms in the soil. Some are beneficial (predatory); others are harmful (root-knot nematodes).

**Open-pollinated (OP)** — A variety that produces offspring true to type from saved seed. All heirlooms are open-pollinated.

**Perennial** — A plant that lives for more than two years. Asparagus, rhubarb, and many herbs are perennial.

**pH** — A measure of soil acidity or alkalinity on a 0–14 scale. 7.0 is neutral. Most vegetables prefer 6.0–7.0.

**Row cover** — Lightweight fabric used to protect plants from cold, wind, and insects while allowing light and water through.

**Side-dress** — To apply fertilizer alongside growing plants during the season, rather than only at planting time.

**Solarization** — Using clear plastic over moist soil during hot summer months to kill weed seeds, nematodes, and pathogens with solar heat.

**Succession planting** — Planting the same crop at intervals (every 2–3 weeks) to extend the harvest period rather than getting it all at once.

**Transplant** — A seedling started indoors or in a nursery and planted out in the garden. Also the act of doing so.

# Afterword: The Southeast Gardening Life

Here's what nobody tells you when you start gardening in the Southeast: it will change you.

You'll start checking the weather obsessively — not for your commute, but for your tomatoes. You'll have opinions about mulch. Strong ones. You'll find yourself explaining to strangers at the hardware store why pine bark nuggets are inferior to pine straw (and you'll be right). You'll eat a sun-warm Cherokee Purple tomato in July and genuinely feel sorry for everyone eating grocery store tomatoes.

You'll lose plants. It happens. A surprise freeze, an invasion of vine borers, a week of rain that turns your garden into a bacterial wilt laboratory. You'll feel the loss more than seems reasonable for a zucchini plant. That's normal. It means you care.

You'll also experience harvests so abundant you'll be leaving bags of squash on your neighbors' porches like some kind of vegetable vigilante. You'll can more tomatoes than any reasonable family needs. You'll eat so many fresh green beans in June that you'll never want to see a can of green beans again.

This is the Southeast gardening life. It's sweaty and buggy and occasionally heartbreaking. But when you walk out to your garden on a cool October morning, mist still rising off the beds, and you pick a perfect head of lettuce that you grew from a seed you planted six weeks ago — there's nothing else like it.

Welcome to the garden. Now go get your hands dirty.
