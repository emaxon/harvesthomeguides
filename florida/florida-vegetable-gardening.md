# Part I: Getting Started in Florida

# Chapter 1: Why Florida Is Different

You picked up this book because you want to grow vegetables in Florida. Maybe you just moved here from Ohio and you're thrilled that winter doesn't exist. Maybe you've been here for decades and you're tired of watching your tomatoes melt in July. Either way, you're in the right place — because gardening in Florida is genuinely different from gardening anywhere else in the country, and most gardening books will steer you wrong.

Here's the thing most people don't realize until their third failed garden: **Florida's growing season is backwards.** In most of the United States, summer is prime time — you plant in spring, harvest through summer, and put the garden to bed in fall. In Florida, summer is the *off-season.* The heat, humidity, rain, and pest pressure from June through September will destroy most vegetable crops faster than you can say "powdery mildew."

Your real growing seasons are **fall through spring.** That's when the magic happens. Cooler temperatures (by Florida standards), lower humidity, fewer pests, and less disease pressure. Plant your tomatoes in September, not April. Harvest your broccoli in January, not June. Flip the calendar in your head, and suddenly Florida gardening makes sense.

## Florida's Three Growing Zones

Florida stretches roughly 450 miles from the Georgia border to Key West, and those miles matter. A February morning in Pensacola might bring frost; that same morning in Miami is 75°F and humid. Throughout this book, we'll reference three distinct growing zones. Find yours now.

### North Florida / Panhandle (USDA Zones 8b–9a)

**Last spring frost:** March 1–15  
**First fall frost:** November 15–December 1  
**Growing personality:** The most "Southern" part of Florida. You'll relate to gardeners in Georgia and Alabama. You get real winters — not brutal, but cold enough to kill tropical plants and give cool-season crops a proper run. Your spring planting season is the strongest, and you'll deal with occasional hard freezes that gardeners in Orlando never worry about.

**Major cities:** Pensacola, Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Gainesville

### Central Florida (USDA Zones 9b–10a)

**Last spring frost:** February 1–15 (light frost possible through early March)  
**First fall frost:** December 15–January 1  
**Growing personality:** The sweet spot. You get a long fall-to-spring growing season, mild enough winters to keep some crops going year-round, and enough of a cool season to grow broccoli and lettuce without bolting overnight. Summer is still brutal, but shorter than South Florida's.

**Major cities:** Orlando, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Lakeland, Ocala, Daytona Beach

### South Florida (USDA Zones 10b–11a)

**Last spring frost:** Frost is extremely rare. Some years, never.  
**First fall frost:** See above.  
**Growing personality:** Tropical. You can grow things nobody else in the continental U.S. can touch — cassava, chayote, calabaza, tropical peppers that fruit year-round. But you also can't grow things that need chill hours, and your summer heat and humidity are legendary. Your primary season runs October through April. Summer is for cover crops and planning.

**Major cities:** Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Naples, Fort Myers, the Keys

## The 2026 USDA Hardiness Zone Map

Florida's USDA zones have shifted over the past two decades. The 2023 update (the most current as of this writing) reflects what Florida gardeners already know: it's getting warmer. North Florida areas that were solidly Zone 8b are creeping into 9a. Parts of Central Florida that were 9b are now 10a.

What this means for you: if you're on a zone boundary, plant for the warmer zone. The trend is your friend here — warmer winters mean longer growing seasons for warm-season crops, but they also mean cool-season crops need more careful timing.

| Zone | Avg. Annual Minimum Temp | Where in Florida |
|------|--------------------------|------------------|
| 8b | 15°F to 20°F | Panhandle interior |
| 9a | 20°F to 25°F | North FL, Panhandle coast |
| 9b | 25°F to 30°F | North-Central FL |
| 10a | 30°F to 35°F | Central FL, Gulf Coast |
| 10b | 35°F to 40°F | South FL coastal |
| 11a | 40°F to 45°F | Miami, Keys |

## Two Growing Seasons — Not One, Not Three

Let's be clear about this because it's the single most important concept in Florida vegetable gardening:

**Spring Season (February–May):** You're planting warm-season crops — tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, cucumbers. In North Florida, this starts later (March). In South Florida, it starts earlier (late January). The clock is ticking because once daily highs regularly exceed 95°F and nighttime lows stay above 75°F, most of these crops stop setting fruit.

**Fall Season (September–January):** This is Florida's *real* gardening season. You're planting warm-season crops again (tomatoes, peppers) AND starting cool-season crops (broccoli, lettuce, carrots, peas). In South Florida, fall planting starts in October. In North Florida, it starts in late August/September. This season is longer, more productive, and less pest-ridden than spring.

**Summer (June–August):** Survival mode. Most gardeners take a break, grow cover crops, or maintain a few heat-tolerant crops like sweet potatoes, Seminole pumpkin, okra, and Southern peas. This is when you plan, amend soil, and prepare for the fall season that's going to be your best harvest of the year.

## The Florida Summer: Why Most Vegetables Give Up

Understanding why summer is the off-season helps you work with Florida rather than against it. Three factors conspire against your garden:

**Heat:** When nighttime temperatures stay above 75°F, tomatoes drop their blossoms. Peppers follow suit above 85°F daytime. Lettuce bolts in a day. Beans get tough and stringy. Most temperate vegetables simply weren't bred for sustained tropical heat.

**Humidity:** Florida's summer humidity regularly exceeds 90%. Fungal diseases — powdery mildew, downy mildew, early blight, late blight, anthracnose — spread like wildfire when humidity is high and air circulation is low. Your plants are essentially living in a petri dish.

**Afternoon thunderstorms:** Florida gets more rain than almost any other state — 50 to 65 inches annually — and most of it falls between June and September. Daily afternoon thunderstorms dump an inch or more in 30 minutes, waterlogging sandy soil (which then drains too fast), splashing soil-borne diseases onto leaves, and creating standing water that attracts mosquitoes and breeds root rot.

The smart Florida gardener doesn't fight summer. You work your hardest in fall and spring, rest (relatively) in summer, and harvest vegetables ten months out of twelve.

## Average First and Last Frost Dates by Region

| Region | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Frost-Free Days |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| North FL / Panhandle | Mar 1–15 | Nov 15–Dec 1 | ~255–270 |
| Central FL | Feb 1–15 | Dec 15–Jan 1 | ~300–330 |
| South FL | Rarely frosts | Rarely frosts | 350–365 |

**A note on frost in Florida:** Even in Central and South Florida, cold snaps happen. The January 2010 freeze brought temperatures into the 20s as far south as Homestead. The December 2022 cold snap caught South Florida gardeners off guard. Always have frost protection ready — even if you use it once every five years.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting on a Northern calendar.** Your neighbor from Michigan will plant tomatoes in May and wonder why they're dead by July. In Florida, May tomatoes are finishing, not starting.
- **Ignoring your zone.** North Florida and South Florida are practically different states for gardening. Use the zone-specific dates in this book, not a generic "Florida" calendar.
- **Fighting summer.** Don't spend money and effort trying to keep a full summer garden alive. Grow what tolerates heat, rest what doesn't.
- **Skipping soil amendments.** Florida's native sandy soil holds almost no nutrients or water. You can't just dig a hole and plant. We'll fix this in Chapter 2.
- **Underestimating humidity.** If you don't plan for fungal disease, fungal disease will plan for you.

# Chapter 2: Understanding Florida Soil

Grab a handful of soil from your Florida yard. Go ahead — I'll wait.

If you're like most Floridians, you're now holding a fistful of sand. Maybe light gray sand, maybe yellow-brown sand, maybe pure white sugar sand that looks like it belongs on a beach (because geologically, it did). Squeeze it. It falls apart. No clumping, no structure, no stickiness. Just sand.

This is the raw material you're working with, and it is — to put it diplomatically — not ideal for growing vegetables. Florida sand drains so fast that water and nutrients pass through like a sieve. It has almost zero organic matter. Its pH ranges from acidic (4.5 in some North Florida areas) to alkaline (7.5+ in South Florida limestone zones). And it's home to a population of root-knot nematodes that would make a parasitologist weep.

The good news: Florida soil is fixable. The even better news: once you understand what you're dealing with, the fixes are straightforward and permanent (with annual maintenance).

## Soil Types Across Florida

### North Florida Sand

Acidic (pH 5.0–6.0), fine-grained, often mixed with some clay subsoil. Drains fast but has slightly more organic matter than further south. Some inland areas have patches of decent loamy sand. This is the easiest Florida soil to work with — it just needs organic matter and possibly some lime to raise pH.

### Central Florida Sand

The classic Florida sand. Light-colored, fast-draining, pH varies (5.5–7.0 depending on proximity to limestone). In areas around Orlando and along the central ridge, you'll find deep sand with almost no organic layer. Along the Gulf Coast, some areas have shell-heavy soil that's more alkaline.

### South Florida Limestone and Marl

South of Lake Okeechobee, the soil changes dramatically. Much of South Florida sits on porous limestone — you may hit rock 6 to 12 inches down. In the Homestead agricultural area, growers literally blast holes in limestone to plant fruit trees. The soil (if you can call it that) is thin marl over rock, with a pH of 7.5 to 8.5. This creates iron and manganese deficiencies in many crops. Raised beds aren't optional here — they're survival.

### Muck Soil (The Exception)

In areas around Lake Okeechobee, the Everglades Agricultural Area, and some river floodplains, you'll find rich, dark muck soil — decomposed organic matter that's incredibly fertile. If you're lucky enough to garden on muck, you mostly just need to manage water levels. The rest of us are jealous.

## Soil Testing: Do This First

Before you add anything to your soil, test it. Florida's soils are so variable that your front yard and back yard might need different amendments.

**Where to test:** Your county UF/IFAS Extension office offers soil testing for $7–10. This is the best deal in Florida gardening. You'll get pH, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and micronutrient levels, plus lime and fertilizer recommendations specific to your results.

**How to sample:** Take 10–15 small scoops from different spots in your garden area, mix them in a clean bucket, and send about 2 cups to the lab. Sample from the top 6 inches.

**What you're looking for:**
- **pH:** Most vegetables want 6.0–6.8. North Florida soils are often too acidic (add lime). South Florida soils are often too alkaline (add sulfur or just grow in raised beds with imported soil).
- **Organic matter:** Florida sands typically test at 1–2% organic matter. You want 5% or higher. This is your main project.
- **Phosphorus:** Often high in Florida soils, especially if previously fertilized. Don't add more unless the test says you need it.
- **Nematode assay:** Ask for this separately. Root-knot nematodes are so common in Florida that knowing your population level before planting saves heartbreak later.

## Building Your Soil: The Organic Matter Mission

Florida soil improvement is fundamentally about one thing: **adding organic matter.** Compost, aged manure, leaf mold, cover crops, mulch that breaks down — anything that adds carbon and biology to your sand. Every other soil fix (water retention, nutrient holding, microbial life, structure) flows from organic matter.

### The Recipe for Florida Sand

For a new garden bed, work in:
- **3–4 inches of quality compost** — mushroom compost, composted cow manure, or homemade
- **1 inch of aged composted manure** (cow, horse, or chicken — not fresh)
- **Coconut coir or peat moss** — 1–2 inches to improve water retention (coir is more sustainable and doesn't acidify as much)

Mix these into the top 8–10 inches of sand. You're not replacing the sand — you're transforming it. The goal is to go from pure sand to a sandy loam over 2–3 seasons of amending and cover cropping.

### Annual Maintenance

Every season (at minimum, twice a year before spring and fall planting), add 1–2 inches of fresh compost on top. In Florida's heat and humidity, organic matter breaks down fast — much faster than in cooler climates. What you added in February will be largely decomposed by August. This isn't a one-time fix; it's a lifestyle.

**Pro Tip:** *If you only do one thing from this entire chapter, make it this: add 3 inches of compost to your garden beds twice a year. This single action solves 80% of Florida soil problems.*

## Raised Beds: The Florida Gardener's Best Friend

Raised beds solve so many Florida problems at once that I'd almost call them mandatory:

- **Soil control:** Fill them with good soil mix instead of fighting native sand or limestone
- **Drainage:** Elevate roots above Florida's high water table (which can be 12–18 inches below the surface in many areas)
- **Nematode management:** Fresh soil mix in raised beds starts nematode-free
- **Ergonomics:** Less bending in a state where you'll be gardening in February while your Northern friends are shoveling snow

### Raised Bed Soil Mix for Florida

The go-to Florida raised bed mix:
- 40% quality topsoil or sandy loam
- 30% compost (mix of mushroom compost and composted cow manure)
- 20% coconut coir
- 10% perlite or coarse vermiculite

Some gardeners use the classic Mel's Mix (1/3 compost, 1/3 peat/coir, 1/3 vermiculite), which works well but costs more for large beds.

**Bed depth:** Minimum 10 inches for most vegetables. 12–16 inches is better, especially for root crops and tomatoes. In South Florida where you're building on limestone, 16–18 inches gives roots room without hitting rock.

**Materials:** Cedar and cypress resist Florida's humidity and termites better than pine. Corrugated metal raised beds are increasingly popular and last forever. Avoid treated lumber in contact with food soil — the newer ACQ treatment is safer than old CCA, but untreated hardwood or metal is peace of mind.

## Composting in Florida

Florida's heat and humidity are a composting superpower. A compost bin that takes 6 months in Minnesota finishes in 6–8 weeks here during summer. The biology never stops working.

**Hot composting:** Turn your pile every 3–5 days in summer and you'll have finished compost in a month. The heat sterilizes weed seeds and pathogens.

**Worm composting (vermicomposting):** Red wigglers do well in Florida but need shade and moisture management. Keep your worm bin in full shade — under a porch overhang is ideal. In summer, freeze water bottles and place them on top of the bedding to keep temperatures below 85°F.

**What to compost:** Kitchen scraps, yard waste (shredded leaves, grass clippings), coffee grounds, cardboard, paper. Florida generates massive amounts of yard waste year-round — rake those live oak leaves every spring and compost them.

**What to avoid:** Citrus peels in worm bins (too acidic), diseased plant material, anything treated with persistent herbicides (aminopyralid contamination is a real problem in Florida horse manure and some commercial compost).

## Mulching: Your Soil's Sunscreen

In Florida, mulch isn't optional. It's the barrier between your soil and a sun that's trying to cook everything beneath it.

**Best mulches for Florida vegetable gardens:**
- **Pine straw:** Readily available, stays in place during thunderstorms, slightly acidifying (good for North Florida)
- **Shredded hardwood:** Widely available, breaks down at a moderate rate, feeds soil biology
- **Hay or straw:** Excellent for vegetable beds, but check for herbicide contamination
- **Leaf mulch:** Free if you have oaks, decomposes quickly, fantastic for soil biology

**Depth:** 3–4 inches around established plants. Keep mulch 2 inches away from stems to prevent crown rot.

**Pro Tip:** *After a hurricane or major storm, your city will be chipping fallen trees. This free mulch is a goldmine. Pile it 12 inches deep on future garden areas and let it cook for 3–6 months before planting.*

## Dealing with Nematodes

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that live in Florida soil and attack plant roots, causing galls (lumpy swellings) that block water and nutrient uptake. They're endemic to Florida's sandy soils, and they're the reason many experienced Florida gardeners swear by raised beds.

**Signs of nematode damage:** Stunted growth, wilting despite adequate water, yellowing leaves, and — if you pull up the plant — roots covered in lumpy galls.

**Management strategies:**
- **Soil solarization:** Cover moist soil with clear plastic for 6–8 weeks during summer. Florida's intense sun heats the soil to temperatures that kill nematodes in the top several inches. This actually works here — our summers are hot enough.
- **Resistant varieties:** Many tomato varieties have nematode resistance (look for "N" in the disease resistance codes: VFN). Florida-bred varieties like 'Solar Fire' and 'Florida 91' have been selected for nematode tolerance.
- **Cover crops:** French marigolds (*Tagetes patula*) and sunn hemp are nematode-suppressive. Plant them in summer and till them under before fall planting.
- **Raised beds with imported soil:** The nuclear option, but it works.

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the soil test.** You can't fix what you don't measure, and Florida soils vary enormously within a single neighborhood.
- **Adding too much phosphorus.** Many Florida soils already have excessive phosphorus from decades of fertilization. Adding more contributes to water pollution (a serious issue in a state surrounded by water) and can lock out other nutrients.
- **Not replacing organic matter.** You added compost last year? Great. It's mostly gone. Add more.
- **Ignoring pH.** A pH of 5.0 or 8.0 means your plants can't access nutrients even if they're present. Test and correct.
- **Using non-composted manure.** Fresh manure in Florida's heat breeds pathogens and can burn roots. Compost it first, always.

# Chapter 3: Water Management

Florida gets more rain than almost any other state — Pensacola averages 65 inches a year, Miami gets 62, and even "dry" Tampa pulls in 46. You'd think watering would be the least of your worries.

You'd be wrong.

Florida's rain falls at the wrong time (summer, when you're barely gardening), in the wrong way (torrential afternoon deluges that run off or waterlog), and through the wrong soil (sand that drains so fast that Tuesday's 3-inch rainfall is gone by Thursday). Meanwhile, during your prime growing season (October through May), rainfall drops dramatically — some months you'll get less than 2 inches.

Water management in Florida isn't about having enough water. It's about **controlling when and how your plants get it.**

## Understanding Florida's Rain Patterns

Florida's rainfall splits into two distinct seasons:

**Wet season (June–September):** 60–70% of annual rainfall. Daily afternoon thunderstorms, sometimes violent. You're managing *too much* water — drainage, standing water, fungal disease, root rot.

**Dry season (October–May):** Your primary gardening season gets the least rain. January and February in much of Florida can go 2–3 weeks without measurable rainfall. This is when irrigation becomes critical.

The irony: when you most need rain for your garden, you don't get it. When you're barely gardening, it won't stop raining.

## Drip Irrigation: The Florida Standard

If you're serious about Florida vegetable gardening, install drip irrigation. It's not optional luxury — it's the most efficient, disease-preventing, water-saving method available.

**Why drip wins in Florida:**
- **Water goes to roots, not leaves.** Wet foliage in Florida = fungal disease. Drip keeps leaves dry.
- **Efficiency.** Drip loses far less water to evaporation than overhead sprinklers.
- **Consistency.** Sandy soil needs small amounts of water frequently. Drip on a timer delivers exactly that.
- **Water restriction compliance.** Most Florida counties have watering restrictions. Drip irrigation is often exempt from day-of-week restrictions (check your local water management district).

### Setting Up Drip Irrigation

**Basic components:**
1. **Backflow preventer** — Required by Florida code on any irrigation connected to potable water
2. **Pressure regulator** — Reduces house pressure (40–60 PSI) to drip pressure (15–25 PSI)
3. **Filter** — Florida's water is hard and often sandy. A Y-filter prevents clogged emitters
4. **½-inch mainline tubing** — Runs along the length of your bed
5. **¼-inch drip emitters or drip tape** — ½ GPH or 1 GPH emitters spaced 12 inches apart, or drip tape for row crops
6. **Timer** — Battery-operated or smart (WiFi timers let you adjust from your phone when a storm rolls in)

**Installation time:** About 2 hours for a 4×8 raised bed, half a day for a full garden with multiple beds. Total cost: $50–150 depending on garden size.

### Watering Schedule by Season

| Season | Frequency | Duration | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Fall planting (Sep–Nov) | Daily | 15–20 min | New transplants and seeds need consistent moisture |
| Cool season (Dec–Feb) | Every 2–3 days | 20–30 min | Lower evaporation, but rain is scarce |
| Spring (Mar–May) | Daily | 20–30 min | Increasing heat, rising water demand |
| Summer (Jun–Aug) | As needed | Varies | Rain usually handles it; supplement during dry spells |

**Adjust for your soil:** Sandy soil may need two shorter watering sessions per day rather than one long one. A 15-minute morning run and a 10-minute afternoon run keeps roots moist without wasting water to deep drainage.

**Pro Tip:** *Stick your finger 2 inches into the soil. Dry? Water. Moist? Wait. This beats any schedule.*

## Soaker Hoses vs. Overhead Sprinklers

**Soaker hoses:** A decent budget alternative to drip. Lay them along rows and run for 30–45 minutes. They're less precise than drip but still keep foliage dry. Replace yearly — Florida's sun degrades rubber quickly.

**Overhead sprinklers:** Generally avoid for vegetables. They wet foliage (hello, fungal disease), lose water to evaporation and wind, and water the weeds along with your crops. The one exception: very light overhead misting during extreme heat events can cool plants and reduce heat stress. But for routine watering, stay low.

## Rainwater Harvesting

Florida receives so much rain that capturing even a fraction of it provides significant garden irrigation. And collected rainwater is slightly acidic (pH ~5.5), which is actually ideal for Florida gardens that tend toward alkaline.

**A basic system:**
- 55-gallon rain barrel connected to a gutter downspout: $50–80
- Captures roughly 600 gallons per 1,000 square feet of roof per 1 inch of rain
- A typical Florida afternoon thunderstorm drops 1–2 inches in 30 minutes — that's 600–1,200 gallons off an average roof

**Scaling up:** Serious Florida gardeners install 275-gallon IBC totes ($50–100 used from food-grade sources) connected in series. Three IBC totes give you 825 gallons of storage — enough to irrigate a substantial garden through a 2-week dry spell.

**Legal note:** Florida law (as of 2024) explicitly permits residential rainwater harvesting. Some HOAs still try to restrict it — Florida Statute 373.62 is your friend if they do.

## Dealing with Too Much Water

During wet season, your problem reverses. Three inches of rain in 30 minutes will flood low-lying garden beds, wash out seeds, and create standing water that breeds root rot, mosquitoes, and misery.

**Prevention strategies:**
- **Raised beds:** Elevating your garden 10+ inches above grade handles most drainage issues
- **Swales and berms:** Direct water flow away from garden areas
- **French drains:** Perforated pipe in gravel-filled trenches carries excess water away
- **Never plant in low spots:** Florida's water table is often just below the surface. That low spot in your yard is low for a reason.

## Hurricane Season Water Strategy

You live in Florida. Hurricanes happen. Your garden will deal with them eventually.

**Before a storm:**
- Harvest everything ripe or close to ripe
- Remove stakes, trellises, and anything that becomes a projectile
- Weight down or remove shade cloth and row covers
- If you use raised beds, they'll handle flooding better than in-ground gardens
- Don't bother covering plants — wind and horizontal rain will destroy covers

**After a storm:**
- Let soil drain for 24–48 hours before walking on wet garden beds
- Rinse salt spray off surviving plants with fresh water (this matters near the coast)
- Check irrigation lines for damage
- Assess soil erosion and replenish mulch
- Don't fertilize immediately — wait a week for plants to recover from stress

**Pro Tip:** *Keep a "hurricane harvest" mentality from August through October. If a storm is 5 days out, pick everything worth picking. You can always plant more; you can't un-destroy a garden.*

## Florida's Water Management Districts

Florida has five Water Management Districts that regulate water use, including lawn and garden irrigation:

- **Northwest Florida WMD** (Panhandle)
- **Suwannee River WMD** (North-Central FL)
- **St. Johns River WMD** (Northeast/Central FL)
- **Southwest Florida WMD** (Tampa/Gulf Coast)
- **South Florida WMD** (South FL/Everglades)

Each district has different watering restrictions — typically limiting landscape irrigation to 1–2 days per week during drought conditions. **Micro-irrigation (drip) and hand watering are usually exempt.** Check your district's current rules at the start of each season.

## Common Mistakes

- **Watering on a fixed schedule without checking soil moisture.** Sandy soil in January needs far less water than sandy soil in April.
- **Overhead watering in the evening.** Wet foliage overnight in Florida's humidity is a written invitation to fungal disease. Water in the morning.
- **Ignoring salt in coastal water.** Well water near the coast can have elevated sodium. Test annually and consider rainwater collection if salt levels are high.
- **No mulch over drip lines.** Drip under 3 inches of mulch reduces evaporation by 50% or more.
- **Overwatering after rain.** Your timer doesn't know it rained. Use a rain sensor ($15) or smart timer to skip watering after storms.

# Chapter 4: Planning Your Florida Garden

If you skipped straight to this chapter, I respect the impulse. You want to plant something. But if you haven't read Chapters 2 and 3, go back — you need soil and water figured out before anything goes in the ground.

Still here? Good. Let's plan a garden.

## Choosing Your Garden Style

### In-Ground Beds

**Best for:** Gardeners with decent soil (muck areas, previously amended sand), large spaces, and crops that need room to sprawl (sweet potatoes, Seminole pumpkin, watermelon).

**Florida reality:** Unless you've been amending your sand for years or hit the muck-soil lottery, in-ground beds require significant soil building. Budget for a lot of compost.

### Raised Beds

**Best for:** Most Florida gardeners. Sandy soil? Raised beds. Limestone under 6 inches of marl? Raised beds. High water table? Raised beds. Nematode problems? Raised beds.

**Size:** 4 feet wide (you can reach the center from either side), any length. 10–16 inches tall.

### Container Gardening

**Best for:** Patios, balconies, renters, and anyone who wants to start small. Florida's mild winters mean containers don't need cold protection most of the year.

**Florida-specific tips:**
- Use light-colored containers — dark pots in Florida sun cook roots
- Self-watering containers are worth the investment; standard pots dry out in hours during spring
- Minimum 5-gallon containers for tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant; 10-gallon is better
- Move containers to afternoon shade during the hottest months

### Vertical Gardening

Florida's limited space (many homes sit on quarter-acre or smaller lots) makes vertical growing smart. Pole beans, cucumbers, small melons, chayote — all climb happily.

## Sun Mapping Your Yard

Most vegetables need **6–8 hours of direct sun.** In Florida, you also want to identify areas that get **afternoon shade** — that 2–6 PM sun is the most intense and brutal, and lettuce, herbs, and even some warm-season crops appreciate a break from it.

Walk your yard at 8 AM, noon, and 4 PM. Note sun and shade patterns. Account for:
- **Trees:** Live oaks, palms, and large shade trees cast shifting shadows
- **Buildings:** Your house creates reliable afternoon shade on the east side
- **Fences:** A 6-foot privacy fence gives useful morning or afternoon shade depending on orientation

**Pro Tip:** *In Florida, partial afternoon shade is a feature, not a bug. A spot that gets morning sun and afternoon shade is ideal for lettuce, herbs, and fall greens.*

## Garden Sizing

Start smaller than you think you need. A single 4×8 raised bed (32 square feet) produces a surprising amount of food in Florida's long growing season.

**Starter garden:** One or two 4×8 raised beds. Grow tomatoes, peppers, herbs, and a couple of greens.

**Intermediate:** Four to six 4×8 beds. Add root crops, beans, squash, cucumbers, and more variety.

**Go big:** 200+ square feet of bed space, possibly including in-ground rows for sprawling crops. This feeds a family year-round with surplus for preserving.

## Crop Rotation Basics

Crop rotation matters in Florida more than in many states because of nematode and disease pressure. The principle: don't plant the same plant family in the same spot two seasons in a row.

**The four-family rotation:**

| Year/Season | Bed 1 | Bed 2 | Bed 3 | Bed 4 |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Fall 1 | Tomato family | Legumes | Brassicas | Root crops |
| Spring 1 | Legumes | Brassicas | Root crops | Tomato family |
| Fall 2 | Brassicas | Root crops | Tomato family | Legumes |
| Spring 2 | Root crops | Tomato family | Legumes | Brassicas |

**Plant families for rotation purposes:**
- **Solanaceae (Nightshades):** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes
- **Cucurbits:** Squash, cucumbers, melons, calabaza
- **Brassicas:** Broccoli, cabbage, kale, collards, cauliflower
- **Legumes:** Beans, peas, cowpeas
- **Alliums:** Onions, garlic
- **Root crops:** Carrots, beets, radishes, turnips

## Succession Planting for Continuous Harvests

Florida's long seasons make succession planting both possible and essential. Instead of planting 20 lettuce plants at once (which all mature, bolt, and die simultaneously), plant 5 every two weeks.

**Best crops for succession planting in Florida:**
- Lettuce and salad greens (every 2 weeks, October–March)
- Radishes (every 2 weeks, October–February)
- Beans (every 3 weeks, March–May and September–November)
- Cucumbers (every 4 weeks, February–April and September–October)
- Corn (every 2 weeks, February–April)

## Companion Planting Quick Reference

We'll cover this in depth in Chapter 20, but here are the Florida essentials:

- **Tomatoes + basil:** Classic for a reason. Basil may deter whiteflies, and both love the same conditions.
- **Beans + corn + squash:** The Three Sisters. Works beautifully in Florida's spring season.
- **Marigolds everywhere:** French marigolds suppress nematodes. Plant them as borders around every bed.
- **Radishes + slow crops:** Radishes mark rows and break up soil crust while slower crops germinate.

## Tool Essentials — What You Actually Need

Florida gardening doesn't require a shed full of specialized tools. Here's what you'll use constantly:

- **Garden fork:** Better than a shovel for working compost into sandy soil
- **Hori-hori knife:** The most versatile tool you'll own. Transplanting, weeding, harvesting, cutting drip line
- **Good-quality hand pruners:** You'll use these daily
- **Stirrup hoe:** For weeding between rows without bending
- **5-gallon buckets:** Free at most bakeries and restaurants. You'll need a dozen.
- **Wheelbarrow or garden cart:** Florida sand is heavy when wet, and you'll move a lot of compost
- **Broad-brimmed hat and sunscreen:** Florida sun is no joke. Year-round.
- **Bug spray:** Mosquitoes are part of the Florida gardening experience. A Thermacell or natural repellent makes mornings tolerable.

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting too big.** Four massive beds plus an in-ground plot equals burnout by March. Start with two beds.
- **Choosing the hottest spot.** Full, all-day Florida sun is too much for many crops. A little afternoon shade is often ideal.
- **Not planning for irrigation before planting.** Run drip lines to beds before you put transplants in.
- **Ignoring succession planting.** One big planting leads to feast-then-famine. Stagger plantings for steady harvests.
- **Forgetting about hurricane season.** Don't build elaborate trellises that can't be taken down quickly. Design for disassembly.

# Part II: Month-by-Month Growing Guide

# Chapter 5: January — Cool-Season Abundance

January is one of Florida's finest gardening months. The air is cool (by Florida standards), humidity is low, pests are at their annual minimum, and your fall-planted crops are hitting their stride. If you did the work in September and October, you're harvesting now.

## What's Happening in the Garden

Your cool-season crops — lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, beets, peas, kale, collards — are in peak production or getting close. Tomatoes and peppers planted in early fall may still be producing in Central and South Florida. The garden is lush and (for once) the bugs aren't winning.

## Plant Potatoes — The MLK Day Tradition

In Florida, potatoes go in the ground in January. Many old-timers plant around Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a memory anchor (just like Valentine's Day for Texas).

- **North FL:** Mid to late January. Choose red varieties ('Red Pontiac,' 'Red LaSoda') for better heat tolerance.
- **Central FL:** Early to mid-January.
- **South FL:** Plant in late December through early January, or you'll run out of cool weather before tubers size up.

Cut seed potatoes so each piece has 2–3 eyes. Let cuts heal for 24 hours. Plant 4 inches deep, 12 inches apart, in loose, compost-rich soil.

## Start Spring Seeds Indoors

If you want tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant for spring planting, start seeds indoors **now**:

| Crop | Weeks before transplant | Start date (Central FL) |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Tomatoes | 6–8 weeks | Jan 1–15 |
| Peppers | 8–10 weeks | Jan 1 |
| Eggplant | 8–10 weeks | Jan 1 |

Use a seed-starting mix (not garden soil), keep trays warm (75–85°F for germination), and provide strong light — a south-facing window works in Florida, but a simple LED grow light is more reliable.

## Continue Succession Planting Cool-Season Crops

Keep planting lettuce, radishes, and greens every 2 weeks. This is your last good window — by March, rising temperatures will trigger bolting. Get 2–3 more successions in now.

**Crops to direct sow in January:**
- Lettuce, arugula, spinach
- Radishes, turnips
- Beets, carrots (if not already in)
- Peas (snap, snow, English)
- Cilantro, dill

## Frost Protection (North Florida)

January is North Florida's coldest month. Hard freezes (below 28°F for 4+ hours) can occur through mid-February.

**Protection methods:**
- **Frost cloth/floating row cover:** Drape over stakes or hoops, securing edges to the ground. Provides 4–8°F of protection.
- **Christmas lights (incandescent):** Seriously. String old-fashioned incandescent lights under row cover for additional warmth on the coldest nights.
- **Mulch heavily:** A thick layer of straw mulch insulates soil and keeps root zones warmer.
- **Water before a freeze:** Moist soil holds heat better than dry soil. Run irrigation the afternoon before a freeze event.

**Don't do this:** Plastic sheeting directly on plants. Plastic conducts cold and will damage any leaf tissue it touches. Use fabric row covers, or support plastic on hoops so it doesn't contact foliage.

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Your coldest month. Protect tender crops, but hardy greens (kale, collards, spinach) actually taste better after a light frost. Keep harvesting. If you haven't planted peas yet, do it now — they need the cool weeks ahead.

**Central FL:** Prime time. Everything cool-season is thriving. Start warm-season seeds indoors. If you're adventurous, you can transplant tomatoes outdoors in late January with frost protection ready — but early February is safer.

**South FL:** Your garden is in full swing. Cool-season crops are peaking. Warm-season crops planted in fall are still producing. Start thinking about which beds to transition to spring warm-season crops next month. Enjoy this — it's the best month in the South Florida garden.

## Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting to start spring seeds indoors.** Tomato transplants from the nursery are fine, but starting your own gives you access to far better varieties.
- **Not protecting North Florida gardens from freezes.** One unprotected night can wipe out a season's work.
- **Ignoring the potato window.** Potatoes need cool weather to tuber. Waiting until February in Central/South FL means smaller harvests.
- **Letting greens go unpicked.** Harvest lettuce and greens regularly — it keeps them producing and delays bolting.

# Chapter 6: February — Spring Planting Begins

February is transition month. The coolest weather is (usually) behind you, day length is increasing, and it's time to start getting warm-season crops in the ground — or at least ready.

This is also when new Florida gardeners get overexcited and plant too early. A late frost in North Florida or an unexpected cold front in Central Florida can kill tender transplants overnight. Patience.

## Tomato and Pepper Transplants

This is the headline event. Tomatoes and peppers go into the garden in February across much of Florida.

**Timing by zone:**
- **South FL:** Early February (you may have planted in January)
- **Central FL:** Mid to late February, once overnight lows are reliably above 50°F
- **North FL:** Late February to early March, with frost protection ready. Many North Florida gardeners wait until after the last frost date (March 1–15).

**Choose Florida-proven varieties:**
- Tomatoes: 'Solar Fire,' 'Florida 91,' 'Everglades' (cherry), 'Heat Wave II,' 'BHN 602,' 'Bella Rosa'
- Peppers: 'Jalapeño,' 'Cubanelle,' 'Sweet Banana,' 'Datil' (a Florida heirloom!), 'Habanero'

**Pro Tip:** *The Datil pepper is essentially exclusive to St. Augustine, Florida. It's a habanero-level heat pepper with a unique fruity sweetness. If you're in Florida, grow Datils. It's the law. (Not actually the law, but it should be.)*

## Direct Sow Warm-Season Crops

As soil temperatures hit 65°F (check with a soil thermometer — they're $10), you can direct sow:
- Beans (snap and lima)
- Corn
- Squash (summer and winter)
- Cucumbers
- Southern peas / cowpeas
- Okra (needs soil temps above 70°F — may be a March crop in North FL)

## Last Hurrah for Cool-Season Crops

Your window for planting new cool-season crops is closing. Lettuce planted now in Central and South Florida will bolt within 4–6 weeks as temperatures rise. North Florida gets another month.

**Plant now (last chance):**
- Quick-maturing lettuce varieties ('Salad Bowl,' 'Black Seeded Simpson')
- Radishes (30-day varieties)
- One more round of cilantro

## Herb Planting

February is herb month in Florida. Most herbs thrive in the warm days and cool nights of late winter:
- **Basil:** Wait until overnight lows are above 50°F. Basil hates cold.
- **Rosemary, thyme, oregano:** Plant now. They'll establish before summer heat.
- **Parsley, cilantro:** Going in now; cilantro will bolt by April. Plant it, enjoy it, don't mourn it.
- **Lemongrass:** Plant divisions now. It'll be a 5-foot clump by fall and doubles as a mosquito deterrent near the patio.

## Prepare Your Spring Beds

If you have beds that grew fall crops and are now empty:
1. Pull spent plants and compost them (unless diseased)
2. Add 2 inches of compost
3. Turn lightly into the top 6 inches
4. Lay drip irrigation if not already installed
5. Mulch and wait for planting day

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Don't rush. Your last frost is 2–4 weeks away. Start hardening off indoor seedlings by setting them outside for increasing hours each day. Prepare beds but don't plant tender crops until frost danger passes. Potatoes planted in January should be emerging — hill them as sprouts appear.

**Central FL:** Prime planting month. Get tomatoes, peppers, and squash in the ground. Cool-season crops are still producing but winding down. Start pulling lettuce beds and transitioning to warm-season.

**South FL:** Warm-season crops are going strong. Cool-season crops are finishing. It's already feeling like spring. By late February, you're in full spring garden mode. This is your last chance to plant cucumbers and squash for spring harvest before summer heat arrives.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting tomatoes too early in North Florida.** One March cold snap destroys a month of work. Wait for your frost date.
- **Not hardening off seedlings.** Plants raised indoors need 7–10 days of gradual outdoor exposure before transplanting. Skip this and they'll wilt, sunburn, or die.
- **Ignoring soil temperature.** Air temperature lies. Soil temperature tells the truth. Beans planted in cold soil rot; beans planted in warm soil sprint.
- **Forgetting to fertilize spring transplants.** Your fall compost is depleted. Side-dress transplants with compost or a balanced organic fertilizer (4-4-4 or similar) at planting.

# Chapter 7: March — Peak Spring Planting

March is go time. Whatever you haven't planted yet, plant it now. The clock is ticking — you have roughly 8–12 weeks before summer heat starts shutting things down, and everything you plant in March needs to produce before that window closes.

## Warm-Season Crops Go In — Everywhere

By March, even North Florida is past most frost risk (though keep row covers handy through mid-month). This is the statewide warm-season planting push:

**Transplant:**
- Tomatoes (last call for North FL)
- Peppers
- Eggplant

**Direct sow:**
- Beans (snap, lima, yard-long)
- Corn (succession plant every 2 weeks through April)
- Cucumbers
- Squash (summer and winter)
- Melons (watermelon, cantaloupe)
- Okra
- Southern peas
- Sweet potato slips (if soil is 65°F+)

## Herb Planting Continues

All herbs are fair game in March:
- Basil (multiple plantings through May)
- Dill (it'll bolt fast — plant, pick, repeat)
- Oregano, thyme, sage
- Mint (in a container unless you want it everywhere)
- Lemongrass

## Pest Watch Begins

As temperatures rise, so does pest activity. March is when you start seeing:
- **Aphids** on new growth (especially brassicas and peppers)
- **Whiteflies** on tomatoes and eggplant
- **Leaf-footed bugs** eyeing your tomatoes
- **Caterpillars** — hornworms on tomatoes, cabbage loopers on brassicas

**Start scouting now.** Walk your garden every morning with a cup of coffee. Flip leaves. Squish early. Early detection beats pesticide every time.

## Install Trellises and Supports

Get trellises, cages, and stakes in the ground before plants need them:
- **Tomatoes:** Florida weave (stake-and-string system) or sturdy cages. Standard flimsy tomato cages are useless — Florida tomato plants are aggressive. Use concrete reinforcing wire cylinders or wooden stake systems.
- **Cucumbers and beans:** A-frame trellises, cattle panel arches, or simple string trellises
- **Melons:** Ground-grow or provide hammock supports on sturdy trellises

## Last Cool-Season Harvests

March is goodbye month for cool-season crops. Broccoli is making side shoots (harvest them — they're delicious). Lettuce is bolting. Peas are finishing. Carrots and beets should be pulled before they get woody in warming soil.

**Don't be sentimental.** Pull spent cool-season crops and replace them with warm-season plantings. That broccoli plant taking up space could be three tomato plants producing 50 pounds of fruit.

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Your peak planting month. Everything goes in now. Protect tender transplants if a late frost threatens (it happens). Start sweet potato slips in water or buy them from a local nursery.

**Central FL:** Full speed ahead. Your tomatoes planted in February should be growing fast. Keep up with staking and tying. Succession-plant beans and cucumbers. Mulch everything — March sun is already intense.

**South FL:** Spring is well underway. Some early-planted warm-season crops are already producing. Start thinking ahead to the summer slowdown — what will you pull in May? Plan your last spring successions now.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting too many tomato plants.** Two well-maintained indeterminate tomato plants can produce 50+ pounds of fruit. Four plants will bury you. Six is a cry for help.
- **Not mulching after planting.** March sun on bare Florida sand bakes roots and evaporates water in hours. Mulch immediately after transplanting.
- **Waiting too long to trellis.** Once a cucumber vine is sprawling on the ground, it's hard to train up. Get supports in at planting time.
- **Ignoring the first aphids.** A dozen aphids become a thousand in a week. Blast them with a hose or squish them now.

---

# Chapter 8: April — Spring Garden Peaks

April in the Florida garden is golden. Your spring-planted crops are producing, the weather is warm but not yet brutal, and you're eating from the garden daily. This is what you've been working toward.

It's also the beginning of the end of spring season. Enjoy it, but start preparing for the transition.

## Spring Harvests Rolling In

By April, you should be harvesting:
- Tomatoes (first ripe fruit from February transplants)
- Peppers
- Snap beans
- Cucumbers
- Squash (first summer squash from March plantings)
- Herbs (basil is booming)
- Last of the cool-season holdouts

**Harvest early and often.** Picking ripe produce signals the plant to keep producing. A tomato left on the vine too long in April heat becomes a split, rotten mess. Pick at first blush and ripen on the counter if needed.

## Pull Spent Cool-Season Crops

If you haven't already pulled your bolted lettuce, flowering broccoli, and done-for peas, do it now. They're taking up space and resources. Compost them (unless diseased) and either:
- Plant a quick warm-season crop (beans, squash)
- Sow a summer cover crop (sunn hemp, cowpeas, buckwheat)
- Mulch the bed heavily and let it rest until fall

## Mulch Everything

By mid-April, Florida is serious about heat. Soil temperatures are climbing, and unmulched beds will exceed 100°F at the surface — lethal for shallow roots.

Apply 3–4 inches of mulch around all plants. Straw, pine straw, or shredded leaves. This single action reduces watering frequency by 30–50% and keeps root zones 10–15°F cooler.

## Irrigation Intensifies

April water demand spikes. If you've been watering every 2–3 days, shift to daily. Run drip in the early morning (before 8 AM) to minimize evaporation.

Watch for signs of water stress: wilting in afternoon (normal — many plants wilt in afternoon heat and recover by morning) vs. wilting in the morning (problem — that means they're not recovering overnight and need more water).

## Sweet Potato Slips

April is prime sweet potato planting time statewide. Sweet potatoes love Florida's heat, tolerate sandy soil, and produce abundantly with minimal care.

- Plant slips 12–18 inches apart in mounded rows or large containers
- Bury the bottom 2/3 of the slip
- Water well at planting, then moderately (sweet potatoes tolerate dry soil once established)
- Harvest in 90–120 days (August–September)

Sweet potatoes are one of the few crops that actually thrive during Florida summer.

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Peak harvest month. Tomatoes are ripening, peppers are producing, beans are going crazy. Keep up with harvesting and pest management. Start planning your summer strategy — what stays, what goes?

**Central FL:** Same energy. The heat is building. Shade cloth (30–50%) over lettuce remnants and young transplants extends their productivity by 2–3 weeks. Consider afternoon shade for peppers — they'll produce longer if they're not in full, all-day sun.

**South FL:** Spring is fading fast. Daytime highs are regularly hitting 90°F+. Begin transitioning to summer survival mode. Pull crops that are declining and replace with heat-tolerant options or cover crops.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not harvesting fast enough.** In April heat, a cucumber goes from perfect to overgrown in 2 days. Check daily.
- **Skipping mulch.** If I had a dollar for every Florida gardener who lost plants to root overheating because they didn't mulch... I'd have a lot of dollars.
- **Overhead watering.** In April's increasing humidity, wet foliage invites fungal disease. Stick with drip.
- **Ignoring squash vine borers.** They appear in April. Check the base of squash stems weekly for sawdust-like frass. Once they're inside the stem, the plant is usually doomed.

---

# Chapter 9: May — Harvests and Heat Prep

May is bittersweet. Your garden is producing its best spring harvest — tomatoes by the bucket, peppers in every color, squash faster than you can eat it. But the heat is building, humidity is rising, and you can feel summer closing in.

## Major Harvest Month

May is the biggest harvest month for spring gardens:
- **Tomatoes:** Harvest everything. In Central and South FL, plants will stop setting new fruit as nighttime temps stay above 75°F. Pick what's there, including green tomatoes (fried green tomatoes are a Southern institution for a reason).
- **Peppers:** More heat-tolerant than tomatoes. They may keep producing into June with some afternoon shade and consistent water.
- **Squash:** Harvest daily. Yellow squash and zucchini can grow 2 inches in 24 hours.
- **Cucumbers:** Same — pick them small for best flavor and texture.
- **Beans:** Final harvests from spring plantings.
- **Herbs:** Basil is lush. Harvest heavily and make pesto for the freezer.

## Remove Declining Crops

As plants stop producing or succumb to disease (bacterial wilt, blight, viral infections all spike in late spring), pull them. Don't leave dying plants in the garden — they're pest and disease reservoirs.

## Plant Heat-Lovers

A few crops actually want Florida summer. Plant or maintain:
- **Sweet potatoes** (already in from April)
- **Seminole pumpkin** — a Florida heirloom that thrives in heat and humidity
- **Southern peas / cowpeas** — fix nitrogen AND produce food in summer
- **Okra** — loves heat, handles humidity, produces all summer
- **Malabar spinach** — a heat-loving vine that tastes like (sort of) spinach
- **Yard-long beans** — tropical beans that produce in conditions that kill snap beans
- **Calabaza** — tropical squash that laughs at Florida summer

## Shade Cloth Installation

If you're keeping any crops through summer, install shade cloth:
- **30% shade:** Good for tomatoes and peppers you're trying to extend
- **50% shade:** Good for herbs and leafy greens you're nursing along
- **70% shade:** Propagation areas, lettuce trials, or just keeping the gardener cool

PVC or metal hoops over beds with shade cloth draped and clipped provide a simple, effective structure.

## Start Planning Fall Garden

Your best gardening season is 3–4 months away. May is when you:
- Review what worked and didn't work in spring
- Order seeds for fall (many popular varieties sell out)
- Decide which beds to rest, cover crop, or solarize over summer
- Start a garden journal if you haven't — your future self will thank you

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Your spring garden is still going strong. Tomatoes may produce into June here thanks to slightly cooler temperatures. But start thinking about the transition — plant heat-lovers now for summer production.

**Central FL:** The bell is ringing. Tomatoes are finishing. Pull spent crops, add compost, and either plant summer cover crops or heat-tolerant vegetables. The garden is shifting from production to maintenance mode.

**South FL:** Summer has essentially arrived. Most spring crops are done. Transition fully to heat-tolerant crops or give beds a rest. If you haven't solarized beds for nematode control, cover them with clear plastic now — June through August is prime solarization time.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trying to save dying tomato plants.** When a tomato plant is declining from heat, disease, and exhaustion, no amount of fertilizer or prayer saves it. Pull it, compost it, move on.
- **Not preserving the harvest.** May's abundance is tomorrow's empty pantry. Freeze tomato sauce, dry herbs, pickle cucumbers, make hot sauce.
- **Empty beds in summer.** Never leave Florida soil bare — it bakes, erodes, and grows weeds. Plant cover crops, mulch deeply, or solarize.
- **Waiting too long to order fall seeds.** Popular tomato varieties like 'Solar Fire' and 'Everglades' sell out early. Order in May or June.

# Chapter 10: June — Summer Strategy

Welcome to Florida summer. If you're new here, you're wondering why the air feels like warm soup and why your garden looks like it's auditioning for a horror movie. If you've been here a while, you know: June is the beginning of the slow season.

Your job this month isn't to grow the most food. It's to **maintain what's thriving, rest what isn't, and set yourself up for a killer fall garden.**

## Summer Crops in Production

Your heat-tolerant crops should be going strong:
- **Okra:** Harvest every 2 days. Pods go from tender to woody in 48 hours.
- **Southern peas:** Harvest pods when they start to dry on the vine (or pick young for fresh eating).
- **Sweet potatoes:** Growing vigorously. No maintenance needed except occasional watering during dry spells.
- **Seminole pumpkin:** Vining aggressively. Give it room to sprawl — 20+ feet is normal.
- **Yard-long beans and Malabar spinach:** Climbing and producing.

## Cover Crops: Improving Soil While Resting

Empty beds shouldn't stay empty. Plant summer cover crops:
- **Sunn hemp (*Crotalaria juncea*):** The king of Florida summer cover crops. Grows 6 feet tall in 8 weeks, fixes nitrogen, suppresses nematodes, and produces massive biomass. Chop and drop or till in before fall planting.
- **Cowpeas (iron clay):** Nitrogen-fixing, heat-loving, edible. Dual-purpose cover crop.
- **Buckwheat:** Fast-growing (6 weeks to maturity), attracts beneficial insects, excellent green manure. Plant in succession.
- **Sorghum-sudan grass:** Deep roots break up compacted soil. High biomass. Not edible but excellent for soil building.

## Soil Solarization

June is the beginning of prime solarization season. If you have beds with known nematode problems or persistent soil-borne diseases:

1. Clear the bed of all plants and debris
2. Amend with compost and water thoroughly
3. Cover with **clear plastic** (not black — you want to trap heat, not block it)
4. Seal edges with soil or boards
5. Leave for 6–8 weeks

Florida summer sun heats solarized soil to 130–140°F at the surface, killing nematodes, weed seeds, and many soil pathogens in the top 6–8 inches. It's the cheapest, most effective soil treatment available.

## Hurricane Prep Begins

Florida's hurricane season officially starts June 1. While the peak isn't until August–October, early preparation protects your garden:
- **Inventory stakes and trellises.** Know what needs to come down quickly.
- **Stock up on frost cloth/row covers** — they're also useful for protecting plants from wind-driven salt spray.
- **Ensure drainage is clear.** Clean out French drains, check raised bed drainage holes, clear debris from swales.
- **Secure loose items.** Pots, tools, and light structures become missiles in tropical storm winds.

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Your last tomatoes may still be producing in early June. Enjoy them, but once they stop setting fruit, pull them. Plant summer crops in any empty beds. Start planning fall seed orders.

**Central FL:** Full summer mode. Maintain okra, sweet potatoes, and other heat-lovers. Solarize empty beds. The garden is on cruise control until August, when you'll start fall prep.

**South FL:** It's hot, it's wet, it's buggy. Maintain tropical crops (calabaza, cassava, Malabar spinach). If you're not growing actively, mulch or solarize beds. This is resting time.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trying to grow tomatoes in June.** Just... don't. Unless you're in an air-conditioned greenhouse, Florida summer will not produce tomatoes.
- **Leaving beds bare.** Bare Florida soil in summer means weed colonization, nematode population growth, and nutrient loss. Cover it — with crops, mulch, or plastic.
- **Ignoring drainage before wet season.** Afternoon deluges are coming daily. If your garden floods, fix it now.
- **Forgetting to water cover crops.** Ironically, even in wet season, newly planted cover crops may need supplemental water during dry spells between storms.

---

# Chapter 11: July — The Dog Days

July in the Florida garden is simple: **keep what's alive going, and start planning for better times.**

The afternoon thunderstorms are daily now. Humidity is stifling. Mosquitoes are aggressive. Your garden is either thriving with heat-tolerant crops or resting under mulch and cover crops. Either is fine.

## Maintain Summer Crops

- **Okra:** Still producing. Keep harvesting every 2 days. Remove lower leaves as they yellow to improve air circulation.
- **Sweet potatoes:** Sprawling happily. Vines may root at nodes — let them. Each rooting point can form a new tuber.
- **Seminole pumpkin:** If you planted one vine, you now have a pumpkin jungle. Immature fruits can be eaten like summer squash.
- **Southern peas and yard-long beans:** Keep harvesting to encourage production.
- **Herbs:** Basil is still going. Rosemary, lemongrass, and mint are thriving. Cilantro is long gone.

## Start Fall Seeds Indoors

**This is the most important thing you do in July.** Your fall garden — the best garden of the year — starts now with indoor seed starting.

| Crop | Start indoors (Central FL) | Transplant outdoors |
|------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Tomatoes | July 1–15 | Late August–September |
| Peppers | July 1–15 | Late August–September |
| Eggplant | July 1–15 | Late August–September |
| Broccoli | July 15–Aug 1 | September |
| Cauliflower | July 15–Aug 1 | September |
| Cabbage | July 15–Aug 1 | September |

**Adjust for your zone:** North FL starts fall seeds 2 weeks earlier. South FL starts 2–4 weeks later.

**The challenge:** Starting seeds in July means growing seedlings during the hottest part of the year. Grow them indoors under lights, in an air-conditioned room if possible. Outdoor germination in July Florida heat is difficult — soil temperatures above 95°F prevent germination for many crops.

**Pro Tip:** *Your air-conditioned house is a better seed-starting environment in July than any greenhouse. A shelf, a $30 LED grow light, and a seed tray — that's your fall garden nursery.*

## Plan Your Fall Garden Layout

While seeds are germinating, plan:
- Which beds are solarizing? They'll be ready by late August.
- Which beds have cover crops? When will you chop them?
- What's your fall crop rotation? (Don't plant tomatoes where you grew tomatoes in spring.)
- What seeds do you still need to order?

## Compost Maintenance

July heat supercharges compost. A well-maintained pile turns kitchen scraps into black gold in 4–6 weeks. Keep it moist (daily rainfall helps) and turn every week or two.

If your compost bin is full, start a second pile. You'll need a lot of compost come August/September bed prep.

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Start fall tomato and pepper seeds indoors in early July. Start brassica seeds by mid-July. Check on solarizing beds. Summer crops are in full production.

**Central FL:** Same as above. The heat is oppressive but the garden is on autopilot. Focus your energy indoors on seedlings.

**South FL:** No rush on fall seeds yet — your fall planting doesn't start until October. Mid-August seed starting is fine for most crops. Maintain tropical crops and rest.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not starting fall seeds.** This is the #1 mistake Florida gardeners make. If you don't start seeds in July, you won't have transplants ready for fall. Nurseries have limited varieties. Grow your own.
- **Overwatering in wet season.** Daily rain + irrigation = waterlogged plants. Turn off automatic timers when it's raining daily.
- **Letting compost dry out between rains.** Despite frequent rain, compost piles can dry out quickly in Florida heat. Check moisture.
- **Giving up on the garden.** July is discouraging. The garden looks rough. But if you're maintaining and planning, you're 6 weeks from the best planting season of the year.

# Chapter 12: August — Fall Prep Begins

August is when the pendulum swings. You're still in summer, but the fall garden is stirring. Your seedlings are growing under lights indoors, your solarized beds are almost ready, and the garden is about to get exciting again.

## Fall Planting Begins (South Florida)

South Florida gardeners: you can start transplanting warm-season crops outdoors in late August. Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant started from seed in July are ready. It's still hot, but South Florida's fall season is long enough that August transplants will produce through January.

Central and North Florida: hold off on transplanting. You're 2–4 weeks away. Focus on bed prep and seedling care.

## Bed Preparation

This is the month to get beds ready for fall planting:

1. **Remove solarization plastic** from treated beds. The soil beneath is sterile and ready.
2. **Chop cover crops.** If you grew sunn hemp, sorghum-sudan, or cowpeas, cut them at the base and either till the tops into the soil or lay them on the surface as mulch. Wait 2 weeks before planting to let material begin decomposing.
3. **Add compost.** Every bed gets 2–3 inches of fresh compost worked into the top 6–8 inches.
4. **Check irrigation.** Run drip systems and replace clogged emitters, cracked tubing, or dead batteries in timers.
5. **Test soil.** If you haven't tested since spring, send samples to your UF/IFAS Extension lab now. Results take 2–3 weeks — you'll have them before planting.

## Harden Off Seedlings

By mid to late August, your indoor seedlings should be 6–8 weeks old and ready to transition outdoors. Harden them off over 7–10 days:
- Day 1–3: 2–3 hours of morning shade outdoors
- Day 4–6: 4–6 hours of partial sun
- Day 7–10: Full outdoor conditions (morning sun, afternoon shade)

August sun is intense. Even hardened seedlings need afternoon shade for their first week in the ground.

## Direct Sow Quick Crops

In late August (Central and North FL), you can direct sow:
- Beans (snap and lima) — last warm-season planting
- Southern peas
- Cucumbers (will produce into fall)
- Summer squash

These fast crops (50–65 days) will mature before cool weather arrives and bridge the gap between summer and fall gardens.

## Hurricane Season Peak

August through October is peak hurricane season. Stay weather-aware:
- Monitor tropical development weekly
- Have a garden hurricane plan (what to harvest, what to protect, what to let go)
- Keep 3–5 days of harvested produce dried or preserved as backup

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Start transplanting warm-season crops outdoors in late August (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant). Direct sow beans, cucumbers, and squash. Start cool-season seeds (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower) indoors if you haven't already. The fall garden is launched.

**Central FL:** Bed prep month. Everything should be ready for September planting. Harden off seedlings. Direct sow beans and quick crops in the last week of August.

**South FL:** Transplant tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant. Direct sow beans and squash. Your fall season starts now and runs through April — savor it.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not amending soil before fall planting.** Summer depleted whatever organic matter was left from spring. Add compost now — your fall garden depends on it.
- **Transplanting into full sun without hardening off.** August sun will fry soft seedlings. Take the time to transition them.
- **Ignoring irrigation maintenance.** Sand and mineral deposits clog drip emitters over summer. Check every line before you depend on it.
- **Planting too much at once.** Stagger fall planting from August through October for continuous harvests rather than one big wave.

# Chapter 13: September — Fall Planting Surge

September is the most important planting month in the Florida garden year. If January is harvest season and July is planning season, September is *action* season. The fall garden is where you'll grow more food, with less effort, than any other time of year.

## The Big Planting Push

Everything goes in this month. Stagger plantings over 2–4 weeks for continuous harvests.

### Warm-Season Transplants (North and Central FL)

- **Tomatoes:** This is your main tomato season. Transplant sturdy, hardened-off seedlings. Provide afternoon shade for the first week.
- **Peppers:** Transplant now. They'll produce from November through January (or longer in Central/South FL).
- **Eggplant:** Same timing as peppers.

### Cool-Season Transplants

- **Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage:** Transplant seedlings started in July. They need 10–14 weeks to mature — September planting means December/January harvest.
- **Collards and kale:** Transplant or direct sow. These workhorses produce all fall and winter.

### Direct Sow

- Beans (snap, lima, yard-long)
- Cucumbers
- Squash (summer and winter)
- Lettuce and salad greens (start succession planting — every 2 weeks through March)
- Radishes
- Carrots
- Beets
- Turnips
- Peas (plant in late September for best results — they need cooling temps)
- Spinach (late September/October in most zones)

## Pest Management Transitions

September's warm, humid conditions mean pest pressure is still high:
- **Whiteflies:** The #1 fall garden enemy. They love tomatoes, eggplant, and squash. Use reflective mulch (silver-colored plastic or aluminum foil strips) to confuse them, and insecticidal soap for established populations.
- **Caterpillars:** Armyworms, loopers, and hornworms are active. Bt (*Bacillus thuringiensis*) spray is your organic best friend — it kills caterpillars and nothing else.
- **Aphids:** Moving from summer weeds into your fresh garden. Knock them off with a hard water spray or use insecticidal soap.
- **Nematodes:** If you didn't solarize, watch for stunted plants and galled roots. Pull affected plants and replace with nematode-resistant varieties.

## Fertilizing Fall Transplants

Fall transplants need a strong start:
- Work a balanced organic fertilizer (4-4-4 or 6-6-6) into the planting hole
- Side-dress with compost 3 weeks after transplanting
- Start a regular liquid fertilizer schedule (fish emulsion or kelp extract every 2 weeks) once plants are established
- Tomatoes get extra calcium — crusite, gypsum, or crushed eggshells worked into the soil prevents blossom end rot

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Your most action-packed month. Everything goes in — warm-season and cool-season. You have a window of about 6 weeks before the first frost, which is enough for warm-season crops to establish and start producing. Cool-season crops will carry through winter.

**Central FL:** Prime time. September plantings will produce from November through March. Stagger lettuce and radish plantings. Get tomatoes in the ground by mid-September for best results.

**South FL:** Fall planting is underway but you're not in a rush — your season runs through April. Focus on warm-season crops now; cool-season crops can wait until October or even November when temperatures moderate.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting cool-season crops too early.** Broccoli transplanted into 90°F September weather struggles. Wait for late September or early October for brassicas unless you can provide shade.
- **Forgetting afternoon shade for new transplants.** September sun is still fierce. Temporary shade cloth over newly transplanted seedlings reduces transplant shock dramatically.
- **Not scouting for whiteflies.** By the time you notice whitefly damage, the population is established. Check leaf undersides weekly starting at planting.
- **Skimping on water.** September is still warm and often dry between storms. New transplants need daily water until established.

---

# Chapter 14: October — Cool-Season Peak Planting

October is when Florida gardening hits its sweet spot. Temperatures moderate, humidity drops, and the garden shifts decisively toward cool-season crops. If September was the warm-season/cool-season straddle, October is all in on cool season.

## Continue Planting Greens and Root Vegetables

This is the ideal month for cool-season crops across Florida:
- **Lettuce varieties:** Plant every 2 weeks. Try butterhead ('Buttercrunch'), romaine ('Parris Island Cos'), loose-leaf ('Red Sails'), and specialty mixes.
- **Spinach:** Direct sow now. Spinach bolts fast in warmth — October's cooling temperatures give it the best start.
- **Carrots:** Direct sow in loose, sandy soil (one of the few times Florida's sand is an advantage — carrots love it). 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Nantes' are reliable.
- **Beets:** Direct sow. 'Detroit Dark Red' and 'Chioggia' are classics.
- **Radishes:** 30-day harvest. Plant every 2 weeks for continuous supply.
- **Turnips:** Direct sow. Grow for roots and greens.

## Garlic Planting

October is garlic month. Plant cloves on or around Columbus Day as a memory anchor.

**Florida garlic reality:** Hardneck garlic (the good stuff with big, easy-to-peel cloves) doesn't get enough chill hours in most of Florida. Grow softneck varieties:
- 'Creole' types — best adapted to warm climates
- 'Inchelium Red' — reliable in North/Central FL
- 'Elephant garlic' — technically a leek, but grows well and produces large, mild cloves

**Planting:** Separate cloves, plant pointy end up, 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart. Mulch with 3–4 inches of straw. Don't overwater — garlic rots in wet soil.

**Source:** Buy seed garlic from Southern suppliers adapted to warm climates. Grocery store garlic is often from China or California and won't perform in Florida.

## Onion Planning

October is when you plan for onions, but planting happens in November/December in most of Florida.

**The critical detail:** Florida must grow **short-day onion varieties.** Our winter day length (10–11 hours) triggers bulb formation in short-day varieties. Long-day varieties (like 'Walla Walla') will never bulb here.

**Good varieties for Florida:** 'Texas 1015,' 'Granex' (the original Vidalia type), 'Red Burgundy,' 'White Bermuda.'

Order onion transplants now from Southern suppliers. They'll ship in November.

## Strawberry Planting

October is strawberry month in Florida — the state is the nation's winter strawberry capital for good reason. Our October-through-March season is perfect for strawberries.

- **Varieties:** 'Florida Radiance,' 'Florida Beauty,' 'Sweet Sensation,' 'Chandler'
- **Planting:** Buy bare-root transplants, plant with the crown at soil level, mulch with pine straw or plastic mulch
- **Spacing:** 12–15 inches apart in rows or 4–6 plants per square foot in raised beds
- **Production:** First berries in December, peak production February–March

**Pro Tip:** *Florida's strawberry season starts when California's ends. You'll be eating homegrown strawberries in December while the rest of the country is eating cardboard supermarket imports.*

## First Fall Harvests

October brings the first returns on your September planting:
- Radishes (if planted in September)
- Quick lettuce varieties
- Herbs galore
- Snap beans from September sowings
- Cucumbers from September plantings

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Your warm-season crops (tomatoes, peppers) from September are growing fast before the first frost. Get cool-season crops in now — you have until mid-November before frost makes transplanting difficult. Plant garlic.

**Central FL:** The perfect planting month. Everything cool-season goes in. Warm-season crops from September are thriving. Enjoy the beautiful weather and get your hands dirty.

**South FL:** Cool-season planting begins in earnest now that temperatures are moderating. Lettuce, carrots, beets, and broccoli transplants go in. Your warm-season crops from August are already producing.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using the wrong onion varieties.** Long-day onions will never bulb in Florida. This is non-negotiable.
- **Not mulching garlic.** Garlic in bare Florida sand dries out and grows poorly. Mulch it thick.
- **Planting strawberries too deep.** If the crown is buried, the plant rots. If roots are exposed, the plant dries. Crown exactly at soil level.
- **Ignoring fall pest transitions.** As caterpillars slow down, aphids ramp up. Switch your scouting focus.

# Chapter 15: November — Cool Season in Full Swing

November in the Florida garden is delightful. The heat is gone, the humidity has broken, and you can work outside for hours without feeling like you're swimming through the atmosphere. Your fall garden is hitting its stride.

## Plant Onion Transplants

November is onion planting month across Florida:
- Plant short-day onion transplants (or sets) 4–6 inches apart, 1 inch deep
- Well-drained soil is essential — onions rot in wet ground
- Fertilize with a nitrogen-heavy fertilizer every 2–3 weeks until bulbs start swelling (January/February)
- Harvest in April/May when tops fall over

## Frost Prep (North Florida)

North Florida's first frost typically arrives mid-November to early December. Be ready:
- Have frost cloth and stakes/hoops pre-positioned
- Move container plants to protected areas on freeze nights
- Harvest tender crops (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) before a hard freeze
- Hardy crops (kale, collards, spinach, carrots, beets) don't need protection down to about 25°F

**After first frost triage:**
- Tomato and pepper plants that survive a light frost can keep producing — prune damaged growth and wait
- Plants that turn to mush are done. Pull them and compost.
- Cool-season crops often taste better after a light frost — cold converts starches to sugars in kale, collards, and carrots

## Continue Succession Planting

Keep planting cool-season crops:
- Lettuce every 2 weeks
- Radishes every 2 weeks
- Spinach (last sowing for the season)
- Peas — November plantings produce in January/February
- Cilantro and dill

## Strawberries Producing

If you planted strawberries in October, the first berries are appearing in late November. Pick them even if they're small — early picking encourages the plant to produce more.

## Fall/Winter Greens at Peak

Your garden should be producing a steady supply of:
- Collards and kale (harvest outer leaves, let the plant keep growing)
- Lettuce and salad greens
- Broccoli side shoots (after the main head was harvested)
- Swiss chard (if planted in September/October)
- Asian greens (bok choy, tatsoi, mizuna)

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Frost protection is the priority. Your fall tomatoes and peppers have a limited window — harvest aggressively. Cool-season crops will carry you through winter. Plant onion transplants.

**Central FL:** Golden month. Warm enough that fall tomatoes and peppers are still producing, cool enough that brassicas and greens are thriving. You're in both seasons at once, and it's wonderful. Plant onions.

**South FL:** Your garden is just getting started. Cool-season crops planted in October are establishing. Warm-season crops from August are in full production. This is the start of South Florida's 5-month gardening paradise.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not protecting North Florida gardens.** One unexpected freeze can end warm-season crops. Have frost cloth ready to deploy.
- **Stopping succession planting.** November feels like the end of planting season (Northerner instinct), but in Florida, you're planting through February. Keep going.
- **Overwatering in cooler weather.** Evaporation drops dramatically in November. Adjust irrigation schedules down — check soil moisture before watering.
- **Ignoring aphids on cool-season crops.** Cooler weather is peak aphid time. Blast them off with water or use insecticidal soap.

# Chapter 16: December — Winter Gardening and Reflection

December is one of the most satisfying months in the Florida garden. While gardeners across most of the country are leafing through seed catalogs from their couches, you're outside harvesting fresh vegetables.

## Winter Greens Harvest

December is peak harvest for:
- **Broccoli:** Main heads from September transplants. After cutting the central head, leave the plant — side shoots produce for weeks.
- **Cauliflower:** Harvest when heads are firm and tight (6–8 inches across). Don't wait — cauliflower deteriorates quickly in the garden.
- **Cabbage:** Firm, heavy heads are ready. Cut at the base and leave the stump — some varieties will produce small secondary heads.
- **Lettuce and greens:** Continuous harvest. Florida's cool December days are perfection for lettuce.
- **Root crops:** Carrots, beets, radishes, turnips — all at peak quality.
- **Peas:** Snap and snow peas from October plantings should be producing.
- **Kale and collards:** Tasting their sweetest after cool nights.
- **Strawberries:** Increasing production through the month.

## Garden Journaling and Record-Keeping

Take an hour this month to document your year:
- What varieties performed well? What flopped?
- When did you plant each crop? When did it produce?
- What pest or disease problems occurred? How did you handle them?
- What would you do differently?

This information is garden gold. Specific variety performance in *your* soil, in *your* microclimate, is worth more than any book (including this one).

## Seed Catalog Review and Ordering

The new seed catalogs arrive. This is dangerous for your wallet and wonderful for your garden. Order seeds for next year's spring and fall gardens now:

**Florida-friendly seed companies:**
- **Johnny's Selected Seeds** — excellent varieties with Southern adaptation data
- **Southern Exposure Seed Exchange** — heirloom varieties selected for the South
- **Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds** — massive selection, many heat-tolerant varieties
- **Tomato Growers Supply** — Florida-based, specializing in tomatoes and peppers
- **Florida Seed & Garden** — specifically curated for Florida growers

## Cold Protection (All Zones)

December brings the year's coldest weather to most of Florida. Even Central Florida occasionally dips into the low 30s.

**Freeze protection checklist:**
- Monitor weather forecasts daily during cold snaps
- Water the garden the afternoon before a freeze (moist soil radiates heat)
- Cover tender crops with frost cloth at sunset, remove after temperatures rise the next morning
- Harvest all ripe tomatoes and peppers before a hard freeze
- Mature root crops (carrots, beets) are fine in the ground through freezes — the soil insulates them

## Planning Next Year's Garden Layout

Map out your beds for the upcoming year:
- Rotate crop families (see Chapter 4)
- Identify beds that need major soil amendment
- Plan new beds or structures
- Budget for supplies (compost, seeds, irrigation parts)

## Regional Notes

**North FL:** Real winter. Hard freezes are possible. Protect what you can, harvest what you can't protect. Hardy crops (kale, collards, carrots, spinach) thrive. This is your cool-season garden's peak.

**Central FL:** Cool but mild. A light frost is possible but unusual before late December. Your garden is in full production — warm-season crops may still be producing alongside cool-season crops. Enjoy this overlap; it's uniquely Floridian.

**South FL:** Perfect gardening weather. The "winter" is 70–80°F days and 55–65°F nights. Your cool-season crops are thriving. Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant are in full production. You're the envy of the gardening world right now.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not keeping records.** You'll forget which tomato variety produced the best. Write it down.
- **Panic during cold snaps.** One night of 32°F with frost protection won't devastate your garden. Sustained freezes below 28°F for hours are the real danger.
- **Ordering too many seeds.** Seeds are cheap, time isn't. Be realistic about what you can plant and maintain.
- **Neglecting the garden during holidays.** Travel, parties, and family events compete with garden time. At minimum, keep irrigation running and harvest ripe produce before you leave.

# Part III: Vegetable Profiles

# Chapter 17: Warm-Season Vegetables A–Z

These crops want heat. They'll die at frost, thrive in warm soil, and — in most of Florida — grow during two windows: spring (February–May) and fall (August–November). A few of these tough customers keep going all summer.

Each profile includes Florida-specific planting dates, recommended varieties, and the tips that make the difference between a mediocre harvest and an outstanding one.

---

## Beans (Snap, Lima, and Yard-Long)

**Snap Beans**

Florida beans are easy, fast, and productive. They're one of the best beginner crops.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow February–April and August–November. Soil temperature must be above 60°F.
- **Days to harvest:** 50–60 days
- **Spacing:** 4–6 inches apart, rows 18–24 inches apart. Bush beans don't need support; pole beans need 6-foot trellises.
- **Best varieties:** 'Provider' (widely adapted, disease resistant), 'Contender' (heat tolerant), 'Blue Lake' (classic flavor), 'Roma II' (flat Italian type)
- **Florida tips:** Plant in succession every 3 weeks for continuous harvest. Beans fix nitrogen — great for building Florida's depleted soils. Inoculate seeds with rhizobium bacteria before planting for maximum nitrogen fixation.
- **Harvest:** Pick when pods are firm and pencil-thick. Don't let them get puffy and seedy — flavor declines rapidly.

**Lima Beans**

More heat-tolerant than snap beans, limas are a Southern staple.

- **When to plant:** March–May and August–September
- **Days to harvest:** 65–80 days (bush) or 80–90 days (pole)
- **Best varieties:** 'Henderson' (bush, small-seeded baby lima), 'Fordhook 242' (bush, large-seeded), 'King of the Garden' (pole)
- **Florida tips:** Limas handle summer heat better than snap beans. Plant pole limas in March and they'll produce into July.

**Yard-Long Beans (Asparagus Beans)**

A tropical bean that actually *likes* Florida summer. Where snap beans give up in June, yard-long beans are just getting started.

- **When to plant:** March–August
- **Days to harvest:** 60–80 days
- **Best varieties:** 'Red Noodle' (purple-red pods), 'Green Noodle,' 'Orient Wonder'
- **Florida tips:** Need a 6–8 foot trellis. Produce prolifically in heat that kills other beans. Harvest when pods are 12–18 inches long (before seeds bulge). A must-grow for Florida summer gardens.

---

## Calabaza (Tropical Pumpkin)

This is Florida's squash. Where butternut and acorn squash struggle with heat and pests, calabaza (*Cucurbita moschata*) thrives. It's the squash you see in every Latin grocery in South Florida — thick-walled, sweet-fleshed, and nearly indestructible.

- **When to plant:** March–August (tolerates full Florida summer)
- **Days to harvest:** 90–120 days
- **Spacing:** These are sprawlers — give them 6+ feet in every direction, or train up a very sturdy trellis
- **Best varieties:** 'La Estrella,' 'Waltham Butternut' (a moschata cousin), or any calabaza type from a Caribbean seed source
- **Florida tips:** Calabaza has excellent resistance to vine borers and powdery mildew — two plagues that destroy other squash in Florida. The fruits store for months in a cool, dry space. Flesh is sweet and dense, perfect for soups and roasting. Cut pieces are sold in Florida grocery stores because the whole fruit can weigh 10–20 pounds.

---

## Cassava (Yuca)

You can grow a tropical staple crop that feeds hundreds of millions of people worldwide — right in your Florida backyard. Cassava is one of the easiest, most low-maintenance crops in the Florida garden.

- **When to plant:** March–June (plant stem cuttings, not seeds)
- **Days to harvest:** 8–12 months (yes, months — this is a long game)
- **Spacing:** 3–4 feet apart
- **How to grow:** Obtain 8–12 inch stem cuttings from a friend, farmer's market, or tropical plant nursery. Push them into the ground at a 45° angle, burying 2/3 of the cutting. Water at planting. Walk away. Seriously — cassava needs almost nothing once established.
- **Florida tips:** Grows in pure sand, tolerates drought, has no significant pest problems in Florida. Harvest when plants are 8–12 months old — dig up the tuberous roots, which can be 1–3 feet long and weigh several pounds each. Peel, boil or roast. Cassava must be cooked before eating (raw cassava contains cyanogenic compounds that cooking neutralizes).
- **Zones:** Best in Central and South FL (Zones 9b–11). In North FL, plant in spring and harvest before frost — the above-ground growth freezes but established roots may survive mild winters.

---

## Chayote (Mirliton)

A perennial vine that produces pear-shaped, mild-flavored squash. It's a Gulf Coast and Caribbean staple that does beautifully in Florida.

- **When to plant:** February–April. Plant the whole fruit (with the single seed still inside) on its side, half-buried, in a mound of compost-rich soil.
- **Days to harvest:** 120–150 days from planting; perennial plants produce for years
- **Spacing:** One plant needs 10–15 feet of climbing space. A fence, pergola, or large trellis is ideal.
- **Florida tips:** Chayote is a vigorous perennial vine in Zones 9b–11. In Zone 9a and north, it may die back to the roots in winter but regrow in spring. Fruits appear in fall (October–December) on short-day-triggered plants. The entire plant is edible — fruit, shoots, leaves, and tuberous roots. One established vine can produce 50–100 fruits per season.

**Pro Tip:** *Find a chayote at a Latin grocery store, let it sprout on the counter, and plant it. That's it. That's the planting instruction.*

---

## Corn

Growing corn in Florida is absolutely possible — just manage your expectations. You won't have Iowa-style acres, but you can have sweet corn for the table.

- **When to plant:** February–April (direct sow when soil is 65°F+)
- **Days to harvest:** 70–90 days
- **Spacing:** 12 inches apart in blocks (minimum 4 rows) — corn is wind-pollinated and needs neighboring plants
- **Best varieties:** 'Silver Queen,' 'Peaches and Cream,' 'Incredible,' 'How Sweet It Is'
- **Florida tips:** Plant in blocks, not single rows, for good pollination. Corn is a heavy feeder — side-dress with nitrogen-rich fertilizer when plants are knee-high and again when tassels appear. Corn earworms are inevitable in Florida — apply mineral oil with a dropper to silk tips when silk first appears to smother earworm eggs. Harvest when silk is brown and dry and kernels squirt milky juice when pierced.

---

## Cowpeas / Southern Peas / Black-Eyed Peas

If you grow one crop in Florida summer, make it cowpeas. They're heat-loving, drought-tolerant, nitrogen-fixing, pest-resistant, and delicious.

- **When to plant:** March–September (one of the few crops that produces in full summer)
- **Days to harvest:** 60–70 days (snap), 80–90 days (dry)
- **Best varieties:** 'California Blackeye #5,' 'Mississippi Silver,' 'Pinkeye Purple Hull,' 'Iron Clay' (for cover cropping and eating), 'Red Ripper' (vigorous vine type)
- **Florida tips:** Direct sow in rows 24–36 inches apart. Cowpeas fix nitrogen — they improve your soil while producing food. Inoculate seeds with cowpea-specific rhizobium for best results. Harvest young pods for snap peas, or let pods dry on the vine for dry storage. A summer garden essential.

---

## Cucumbers

Cucumbers are a quick, productive spring and fall crop in Florida.

- **When to plant:** February–April and August–October
- **Days to harvest:** 50–65 days
- **Spacing:** 12–18 inches apart on a trellis (trellising improves fruit quality and air circulation)
- **Best varieties:** 'Marketmore 76' (reliable slicer), 'Diva' (burpless, seedless), 'Straight Eight,' 'National Pickling,' 'Poinsett 76' (heat-tolerant, bred in the South)
- **Florida tips:** Grow on trellises to prevent soil contact (reduces disease). Downy mildew is the #1 cucumber killer in Florida — choose resistant varieties and apply preventive fungicide (copper spray or potassium bicarbonate) in humid weather. Harvest frequently — a cucumber left on the vine too long signals the plant to stop producing. Bees are essential for pollination; avoid spraying insecticides during flowering.

---

## Eggplant

Eggplant is Florida's unsung hero. It handles heat and humidity better than tomatoes, has fewer disease problems, and produces over a longer season.

- **When to plant:** Transplant February–March and August–September
- **Days to harvest:** 70–85 days from transplant
- **Spacing:** 24–30 inches apart
- **Best varieties:** 'Florida Market' (the classic), 'Black Beauty,' 'Ichiban' (long, slender Asian type), 'Orient Express,' 'Thai Long Green'
- **Florida tips:** Start from transplants, not direct sowing. Eggplant tolerates Florida's heat better than any other nightshade — fall-planted eggplant may produce from November through April in Central and South FL. Flea beetles are the primary pest — tiny shotgun-hole damage on leaves. Row cover until flowering, then switch to kaolin clay spray if needed. Harvest when fruits are glossy and firm; dull skin means overripe.

---

## Malabar Spinach

Not true spinach, but a tropical vine that fills the spinach gap during Florida's hot months when real spinach is a distant memory.

- **When to plant:** March–August
- **Days to harvest:** 70 days to first harvest, then continuous
- **Best varieties:** Red-stemmed (more ornamental), green-stemmed (milder flavor)
- **Florida tips:** A perennial vine in Zones 10–11. Give it a trellis and full sun. Thick, succulent leaves have a mild, slightly mucilaginous texture (similar to okra). Excellent in stir-fries, soups, and smoothies. Self-seeds aggressively in South Florida — you'll never need to replant. One of the few leafy greens that thrives in full Florida summer.

---

## Melons (Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Honeydew)

Florida grows more watermelon commercially than almost any other state. You can grow them at home too.

**Watermelon**

- **When to plant:** March–April (direct sow or transplant)
- **Days to harvest:** 80–100 days
- **Spacing:** 4–6 feet between plants, 6–8 feet between rows (or grow on a fence for small varieties)
- **Best varieties:** 'Crimson Sweet,' 'Sugar Baby' (icebox/small), 'Florida Giant,' 'Charleston Gray,' 'Jubilee'
- **Florida tips:** Watermelons need bees for pollination and deep, infrequent watering (drought stress before harvest concentrates sugars). Thump test: a ripe watermelon sounds hollow. Check the ground spot — it turns from white to creamy yellow when ripe. Fusarium wilt is common in Florida — rotate planting sites and choose resistant varieties.

**Cantaloupe and Honeydew**

- **When to plant:** February–March
- **Days to harvest:** 75–90 days
- **Best varieties:** 'Ambrosia' (cantaloupe, incredible flavor), 'Hales Best,' 'Honey Rock'
- **Florida tips:** More disease-prone than watermelon in Florida's humidity. Drip irrigation and trellising help tremendously. Cantaloupes slip (detach) from the vine when ripe — if you have to pull, they're not ready.

---

## Okra

Okra laughs at Florida summer. It's one of the few crops that genuinely loves 95°F days and produces all the more for it.

- **When to plant:** March–July (direct sow when soil is 70°F+)
- **Days to harvest:** 55–65 days
- **Spacing:** 12–18 inches apart, rows 3 feet apart. Plants grow 4–6 feet tall.
- **Best varieties:** 'Clemson Spineless' (the standard), 'Emerald,' 'Burgundy' (red-podded, beautiful), 'Hill Country Red,' 'Star of David' (fat, tender pods)
- **Florida tips:** Soak seeds overnight before planting to speed germination. Harvest pods at 3–4 inches — larger pods become tough and woody. Harvest EVERY 2 DAYS in summer; okra grows fast. Wear long sleeves when harvesting — the leaves and stems have tiny spines that irritate skin. Cut plants back to 12–18 inches in late August for a flush of fall production.

---

## Peppers (Sweet and Hot)

Peppers are the most rewarding crop in the Florida garden. More heat-tolerant than tomatoes, longer-producing, and available in endless variety.

**Sweet Peppers**

- **When to plant:** Transplant February–March and August–September
- **Days to harvest:** 65–80 days (green), 80–100 days (ripe color)
- **Best varieties:** 'California Wonder,' 'Jupiter,' 'Gypsy' (early, prolific), 'Cubanelle' (thin-walled frying pepper — a Florida favorite), 'Sweet Banana'
- **Florida tips:** Sweet peppers struggle in peak summer heat (blossoms drop above 90°F). For continuous production, plant in September for fall/winter harvest — peppers planted in September in Central FL will produce from November through April or later.

**Hot Peppers**

- **When to plant:** Same as sweet peppers
- **Best varieties:** 'Datil' (the Florida heirloom — grow it), 'Habanero,' 'Jalapeño,' 'Tabasco,' 'Thai Hot,' 'Ghost Pepper' (superhots love Florida heat)
- **Florida tips:** Hot peppers tolerate summer heat better than sweet peppers. A single Datil pepper plant can produce 100+ peppers per season. In South Florida, hot pepper plants are often perennial — protect from rare freezes and they'll produce for years. Superhot varieties (Ghost, Reaper, Scorpion) need a long season — plant in February and let them grow all year.

**Pro Tip:** *Make Datil pepper sauce. It's St. Augustine's contribution to American cuisine and it's spectacular. Recipe: blend Datil peppers with vinegar, mustard, and a touch of brown sugar. You'll never buy Tabasco again.*

---

## Seminole Pumpkin

The ultimate Florida vegetable. Seminole pumpkin (*Cucurbita moschata*) was cultivated by the Seminole people for centuries precisely because it thrives in Florida's challenging conditions.

- **When to plant:** March–July
- **Days to harvest:** 90–120 days
- **Spacing:** Give it room. One vine can cover a 20×20 foot area. Many gardeners let it climb trees — the fruits dangle spectacularly.
- **Florida tips:** Resistant to vine borers, powdery mildew, and downy mildew — the three plagues that kill other squash in Florida. Produces in full summer heat. Buff-colored, football-sized fruits have sweet, orange flesh similar to butternut squash. Stores for months at room temperature. This is the squash you should be growing in Florida. If you grow no other squash, grow Seminole pumpkin.

---

## Squash (Summer and Winter)

**Summer Squash (Yellow, Zucchini, Pattypan)**

- **When to plant:** February–April and August–October
- **Days to harvest:** 45–55 days
- **Best varieties:** 'Yellow Crookneck,' 'Early Prolific Straightneck,' 'Black Beauty' zucchini, 'Costata Romanesco' (nutty flavor), 'Pattypan/Scallop'
- **Florida tips:** Summer squash is fast and productive but short-lived in Florida. Squash vine borers and powdery mildew typically kill plants within 4–8 weeks of production. Succession-plant every 3–4 weeks for continuous harvest. Check stem bases weekly for borer frass.

**Winter Squash**

- **When to plant:** February–March and August–September
- **Days to harvest:** 80–110 days
- **Best varieties:** 'Waltham Butternut' (the best performer in Florida — *moschata* type), 'Tromboncino' (climbing moschata), Seminole pumpkin (see above)
- **Florida tips:** Stick with *Cucurbita moschata* types in Florida — they resist vine borers and mildew far better than *C. maxima* (Hubbard, kabocha) or *C. pepo* (acorn, delicata) types. Butternuts and Seminoles are your friends; most other winter squash varieties will struggle.

---

## Sweet Potatoes

Florida is sweet potato paradise. They love our heat, tolerate our sand, and produce with minimal care.

- **When to plant:** April–June (plant slips/cuttings)
- **Days to harvest:** 90–120 days
- **Spacing:** 12–18 inches apart in rows or mounded beds
- **Best varieties:** 'Beauregard' (the standard — orange flesh, great yields), 'Covington,' 'Jewel,' 'Georgia Jet' (early maturing), 'Okinawan' (purple flesh — spectacular)
- **Where to get slips:** Buy from a nursery, order from Southern suppliers, or grow your own by suspending a sweet potato in a jar of water until it sprouts (start in February for April planting).
- **Florida tips:** Sweet potatoes grow through full Florida summer. Plant in April or May, harvest in August or September. The vines spread aggressively — let them, or grow in contained raised beds. Cure harvested sweet potatoes at 80–85°F with high humidity for 7–10 days to convert starches to sugars (a hot garage or covered porch in Florida summer is perfect). After curing, they store for 6+ months.

## Tomatoes

The reason most people start a Florida garden. Also the crop most likely to break a Florida gardener's heart. Here's how to succeed.

**When to plant:** Transplant January–March (spring) and August–September (fall). Fall is the better season for Florida tomatoes.

**Days to harvest:** 65–85 days from transplant

**Spacing:** 24–36 inches apart for determinate; 36–48 inches for indeterminate

**Best varieties for Florida:**

| Variety | Type | Days | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Solar Fire | Determinate | 72 | Heat-tolerant, UF bred, sets fruit in high temps |
| Florida 91 | Determinate | 72 | Disease resistant, commercial quality |
| BHN 602 | Determinate | 72 | Excellent flavor, widely adapted |
| Everglades | Indeterminate cherry | 65 | Tiny, prolific, nearly indestructible |
| Heat Wave II | Determinate | 68 | Sets fruit above 90°F — rare trait |
| Sweet 100 | Indeterminate cherry | 65 | Prolific, sweet, reliable |
| Cherokee Purple | Indeterminate | 80 | Heirloom flavor, needs fall season |
| Bella Rosa | Determinate | 75 | VFN resistant, good size |

**Florida tomato essentials:**

- **Fall is your best tomato season.** September-planted tomatoes produce from November through January (or later in Central/South FL) with less disease pressure, fewer pests, and better fruit quality than spring tomatoes.
- **Disease resistance matters.** Look for VFN (Verticillium, Fusarium, Nematode) resistance. In Florida's humid conditions, disease-resistant varieties dramatically outperform heirlooms.
- **Stake and prune.** Florida weave or sturdy cages. Remove suckers below the first flower cluster on indeterminate varieties. Good air circulation prevents disease.
- **Water at the base.** Drip only. Never overhead water tomatoes in Florida. Wet foliage + humidity = early blight, late blight, bacterial spot, and leaf mold.
- **Calcium for blossom end rot.** Mix calcium sulfate (gypsum) into the planting hole. Water consistently — blossom end rot is caused by calcium uptake problems, usually related to inconsistent watering.
- **Know when to quit.** Spring tomatoes in Central FL stop setting fruit by late May. Fall tomatoes in North FL end with the first hard freeze. Don't baby dying plants — pull them and move on.

**Pro Tip:** *Everglades tomatoes are Florida's secret weapon. These tiny cherry tomatoes self-seed, resist virtually every disease, produce hundreds of fruits per plant, and keep going through conditions that kill everything else. Plant one and you'll have Everglades tomatoes forever — they reseed aggressively.*

# Chapter 18: Cool-Season Vegetables A–Z

These crops want cooler weather — they bolt (go to seed) in heat and thrive in Florida's October-through-March window. Some can handle light frost; a few actually taste better after a cold snap.

---

## Beets

Easy, fast, and beautiful — beets are an excellent Florida cool-season crop.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow October–February
- **Days to harvest:** 50–65 days
- **Spacing:** 3–4 inches apart (thin seedlings — beet "seeds" are actually clusters)
- **Best varieties:** 'Detroit Dark Red' (classic), 'Chioggia' (candy-striped inside), 'Golden' (won't stain everything), 'Cylindra' (uniform slicing)
- **Florida tips:** Florida's sandy soil is actually decent for beets — roots grow straight without obstruction. Beet greens are edible and nutritious — harvest outer leaves for salads while roots size up. Beets like consistent moisture; mulch and drip irrigation prevent woody, bitter roots.

---

## Broccoli & Cauliflower

The crown jewels of the Florida cool-season garden. Nothing says "I know what I'm doing" like harvesting broccoli in December.

**Broccoli**

- **When to plant:** Transplant September–November (start seeds indoors July–September)
- **Days to harvest:** 70–90 days from transplant
- **Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart
- **Best varieties:** 'Waltham 29,' 'De Cicco' (prolific side shoots), 'Green Magic,' 'Calabrese'
- **Florida tips:** Broccoli bolts fast in warmth — timing is everything. Transplant when daytime highs are consistently below 85°F. After cutting the main head, leave the plant for side shoot production — you'll get weeks of additional harvests. Cabbage loopers are the main pest — inspect heads and use Bt spray.

**Cauliflower**

- **When to plant:** Transplant October–November
- **Days to harvest:** 75–100 days from transplant
- **Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart
- **Best varieties:** 'Snowball' (classic white), 'Cheddar' (orange, higher vitamin A), 'Graffiti' (purple, stunning), 'Romanesco' (fractal spirals, conversation starter)
- **Florida tips:** More finicky than broccoli — cauliflower needs consistent cool temperatures and consistent moisture. Hot spells cause "buttoning" (tiny, premature heads). Plant later than broccoli to avoid early-season heat. Blanch white varieties by tying leaves over the developing head when it's golf-ball sized.

---

## Brussels Sprouts

Honest talk: Brussels sprouts are the hardest brassica to grow in Florida. They need 90–120 days of cool weather, and most of Florida doesn't reliably provide that. But North Florida gardeners can succeed.

- **When to plant:** Transplant September (North FL only, or high-risk gamble in Central FL)
- **Days to harvest:** 90–120 days from transplant
- **Best varieties:** 'Long Island Improved,' 'Jade Cross'
- **Florida tips:** Plant early, provide afternoon shade, keep soil consistently moist. Even in North FL, expect smaller sprouts than what you'd grow in New England. The effort-to-reward ratio is low compared to other brassicas. If you're in Central or South FL, spend that bed space on broccoli instead.

---

## Cabbage

Reliable, productive, and surprisingly versatile. Cabbage is a Florida cool-season workhorse.

- **When to plant:** Transplant September–November
- **Days to harvest:** 70–90 days from transplant
- **Spacing:** 15–18 inches apart
- **Best varieties:** 'Flat Dutch,' 'Copenhagen Market,' 'Savoy Ace,' 'Red Acre' (red cabbage)
- **Florida tips:** Cabbage handles light frost well — leave it in the garden through North Florida winter. For South Florida, plant in November for January/February harvest. Cabbage loopers and imported cabbage worms are constant pests — Bt spray applied weekly keeps them in check.

---

## Carrots

Florida sand: terrible for most crops, perfect for carrots. Straight, unbranched roots need loose soil, and Florida delivers.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow September–January
- **Days to harvest:** 65–80 days
- **Spacing:** 2–3 inches apart (thin mercilessly — overcrowded carrots produce tiny roots)
- **Best varieties:** 'Danvers Half Long' (heat-tolerant), 'Nantes' (sweet, tender), 'Chantenay' (stocky, good for heavier soils), 'Scarlet Nantes'
- **Florida tips:** Carrot seeds are tiny and slow to germinate (14–21 days). Keep the seedbed consistently moist until sprouts appear — cover with a thin layer of vermiculite or burlap to retain moisture. Sandy soil means easy harvest — pull or fork them up with no resistance. Flavor improves after cool nights, so late-season carrots (harvested January–February) are sweetest.

---

## Collards & Kale

The backbone of the Southern cool-season garden. Both are virtually indestructible, extremely nutritious, and produce for months.

**Collards**

- **When to plant:** Transplant or direct sow August–November
- **Days to harvest:** 60–80 days, then continuous
- **Best varieties:** 'Georgia Southern' (the classic), 'Vates,' 'Morris Heading,' 'Champion'
- **Florida tips:** Collards handle both heat and cold better than any other brassica. They'll produce from September through April in most of Florida. Harvest outer leaves and let the plant keep growing. In South Florida, collards can be a near-year-round crop with some shade in summer.

**Kale**

- **When to plant:** Direct sow or transplant September–November
- **Best varieties:** 'Lacinato/Dinosaur' (most heat-tolerant), 'Red Russian,' 'Curly Scotch,' 'Winterbor'
- **Florida tips:** Kale is sweeter after frost — North Florida gardeners get the best kale. 'Lacinato' tolerates warmth better than curly types. Harvest outer leaves, never the central growing point. Kale chips (torn, tossed in olive oil, baked at 300°F until crisp) convert even skeptics.

---

## Garlic

See October chapter for planting details. Here are the growing specifics:

- **When to plant:** October–November
- **Days to harvest:** 150–180 days (harvest April–May)
- **Spacing:** 6 inches apart, 1–2 inches deep
- **Best varieties:** Softneck types: 'Creole' (best for warm climates), 'Inchelium Red,' 'Silver Rose.' Elephant garlic for large, mild cloves.
- **Florida tips:** Garlic needs well-drained soil — raised beds are ideal. Don't overwater. Stop watering 2 weeks before harvest (when lower leaves brown). Cure in a shaded, dry area for 2–3 weeks before storage. Florida-grown garlic won't rival what you'd grow in Vermont, but it's absolutely possible and the fresh flavor is worth it.

---

## Lettuce & Salad Greens

Lettuce is Florida's cool-season superstar. During the prime months (November–February), you can grow lettuce that rivals anything in a fancy restaurant.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow or transplant October–February
- **Days to harvest:** 30 days (baby leaf) to 60 days (full heads)
- **Spacing:** 6–12 inches apart (heads) or broadcast-sow and cut as baby greens
- **Best varieties:**
  - Romaine: 'Parris Island Cos,' 'Jericho' (heat-tolerant)
  - Butterhead: 'Buttercrunch,' 'Tom Thumb' (container-sized)
  - Loose-leaf: 'Red Sails,' 'Black Seeded Simpson,' 'Salad Bowl'
  - Specialty: Arugula, mâche, endive, radicchio
- **Florida tips:** Lettuce bolts when temperatures exceed 80°F and day length increases. Plant heat-tolerant varieties ('Jericho,' 'Muir') for extending the season into March. Cut-and-come-again harvesting (cut leaves 1 inch above the base) gives you 3–4 harvests per planting. Succession-plant every 2 weeks from October through February for uninterrupted salads.

---

## Onions

- **When to plant:** Transplant November–December
- **Days to harvest:** 120–150 days (harvest March–May)
- **Spacing:** 4–6 inches apart
- **Best varieties:** Short-day ONLY: 'Texas 1015' (sweet), 'Granex/Vidalia,' 'Red Burgundy,' 'White Bermuda'
- **Florida tips:** Onions are heavy feeders — side-dress with nitrogen every 2–3 weeks. Stop fertilizing when bulbs start swelling (you'll see the soil crack around the base). Harvest when 50% of tops have fallen over. Cure in a shaded, dry spot for 1–2 weeks. Sweet onions don't store well — eat them within a month or two, or freeze chopped onion for later use.

---

## Peas (English, Snap, and Snow)

Peas are one of Florida's most rewarding cool-season crops — sweet, fresh, and impossible to buy in comparable quality at the store.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow October–January
- **Days to harvest:** 55–70 days
- **Spacing:** 2–4 inches apart, with trellis support for climbing varieties
- **Best varieties:** 'Sugar Snap' (snap pea, eat pod and all), 'Oregon Sugar Pod' (snow pea), 'Wando' (English/shelling pea, heat-tolerant), 'Super Sugar Snap'
- **Florida tips:** Inoculate seeds with pea/legume rhizobium bacteria for best nitrogen fixation. Peas need a trellis — even "bush" varieties produce better with support. In South Florida, plant in November or December for January/February harvest; in North Florida, October planting catches cool weather perfectly. Peas don't transplant well — always direct sow.

---

## Potatoes

- **When to plant:** January–February (North/Central FL), December–January (South FL)
- **Days to harvest:** 80–100 days
- **Spacing:** 12 inches apart, 4 inches deep, in rows or raised beds
- **Best varieties:** 'Red Pontiac,' 'Red LaSoda,' 'Yukon Gold,' 'Gold Rush,' 'Kennebec'
- **Florida tips:** Buy certified seed potatoes — grocery store potatoes are often treated with sprout inhibitor. Hill soil or mulch around stems as plants grow (potatoes form along the buried stem). Harvest when tops die back or 2 weeks after flowering. Don't wash potatoes until you're ready to use them — unwashed potatoes store longer. Florida's short, mild winter gives a compact but productive potato season.

---

## Radishes

The fastest vegetable you can grow. Radishes go from seed to table in 25–30 days and are foolproof in Florida's cool season.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow October–February
- **Days to harvest:** 25–35 days
- **Spacing:** 2 inches apart
- **Best varieties:** 'Cherry Belle,' 'French Breakfast,' 'Easter Egg' (multi-colored mix), 'Watermelon' (daikon type — green outside, pink inside), 'Daikon' (large white Asian radish)
- **Florida tips:** Succession-plant every 2 weeks for continuous harvest. Radishes left in warm soil too long become pithy and hot-flavored. Pull as soon as they size up. Daikon radishes double as a soil-breaking cover crop — their deep roots penetrate compacted sand layers.

---

## Spinach

Real spinach (*Spinacia oleracea*) is a cool-season specialist that bolts fast in Florida warmth. Time it right and you'll have incredible spinach. Time it wrong and you'll have a sad, flowering stick.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow October–January (November is ideal for most of Florida)
- **Days to harvest:** 35–45 days (baby leaf) to 50–60 days (mature)
- **Best varieties:** 'Bloomsdale Long Standing' (the classic), 'Space' (slow to bolt), 'Tyee,' 'Renegade'
- **Florida tips:** Plant in partial shade for extended harvest. Spinach bolts when temperatures exceed 75°F and day length exceeds 12 hours — it's a race against the calendar. In Central and South FL, grow in the shade of taller crops (like trellised peas) to extend the harvest. For summer spinach cravings, grow Malabar spinach (Chapter 17) instead.

---

## Strawberries

Florida is the nation's #1 winter strawberry producer, and home gardeners can tap into that same magic.

- **When to plant:** October–November (bare-root transplants)
- **Days to harvest:** 60–90 days to first fruit, then continuous through March
- **Spacing:** 12–15 inches apart
- **Best varieties:** 'Florida Radiance' (developed by UF — the standard), 'Florida Beauty,' 'Sweet Sensation,' 'Chandler,' 'Camarosa'
- **Florida tips:** Florida grows strawberries as annuals — plant fresh each October. Mulch with pine straw or use plastic mulch (commercial growers use raised beds with black/white plastic — white side up to reflect heat). Keep berries off the soil to prevent rot. Birds love strawberries — netting is your friend. Remove runners to direct energy into fruit production. Pick every other day for peak flavor.

---

## Turnips

Easy, dual-purpose (roots and greens), and fast-growing. Turnips are an underrated Florida cool-season crop.

- **When to plant:** Direct sow September–February
- **Days to harvest:** 35–50 days (greens faster, roots longer)
- **Spacing:** 4–6 inches apart for roots, closer for greens only
- **Best varieties:** 'Purple Top White Globe' (the classic), 'Hakurei' (Japanese salad turnip — sweet, eat raw), 'Seven Top' (greens only — no root development, grown for the exceptional greens)
- **Florida tips:** Turnip greens are a Southern staple and arguably more valuable than the roots. Plant 'Seven Top' or 'Southern Green' for maximum greens production. Baby 'Hakurei' turnips are crisp, sweet, and convert turnip-skeptics — grow them for farmers market sales or impressing dinner guests.

# Part IV: Mastering the Details

# Chapter 19: Pest & Disease Management

You can do everything right in the Florida garden — perfect soil, perfect water, perfect timing — and pests and diseases will still show up. Florida's warm, humid climate is a paradise for insects and fungi as much as it is for gardeners.

The good news: you don't need to eliminate pests. You need to manage them. The framework for that is called **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**, and it's the only sane approach in Florida.

## The IPM Approach

IPM is a decision-making system, not a product. Here's how it works:

1. **Prevention:** Choose resistant varieties, rotate crops, maintain healthy soil, keep the garden clean.
2. **Monitoring:** Scout your garden regularly. Know what's normal and what's a problem.
3. **Identification:** Is that bug a pest or a beneficial? Is that spot a disease or just water splash? Identify before you act.
4. **Threshold:** Not every pest needs treatment. A few aphids aren't a crisis. A hundred aphids per plant are.
5. **Action:** Start with the least toxic method. Hand-pick. Water blast. Biological controls. Then targeted organic sprays. Synthetic chemicals are the last resort, not the first.

## The Top 15 Florida Garden Pests

### 1. Whiteflies

**Damage:** Sap-sucking insects that cluster on leaf undersides. Cause yellowing, sticky honeydew, and sooty mold. Transmit devastating viruses (tomato yellow leaf curl, among others).

**Target crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash, beans

**Management:**
- Reflective mulch (silver/aluminum) confuses whiteflies and reduces landing
- Yellow sticky traps monitor and reduce populations
- Insecticidal soap or neem oil sprayed on leaf undersides (direct contact required)
- Encourage natural predators (lacewings, ladybugs, parasitic wasps)
- Remove heavily infested plants before they become virus factories

### 2. Aphids

**Damage:** Colonies of soft-bodied insects on new growth, causing leaf curling, stunting, and honeydew/sooty mold.

**Target crops:** Nearly everything, but especially brassicas, peppers, and lettuce

**Management:**
- Hard water spray from a hose dislodges aphids (repeat every 2–3 days)
- Insecticidal soap for heavy infestations
- Ladybugs and lacewings are voracious aphid predators
- Remove affected leaves on small infestations

### 3. Caterpillars (Hornworms, Loopers, Armyworms)

**Damage:** Chewing insects that devour leaves, fruits, and stems.

**Target crops:** Tomatoes (hornworms), brassicas (loopers, imported cabbage worms), corn (armyworms), peppers

**Management:**
- Hand-pick large caterpillars (hornworms are impressive but squishable)
- **Bt (*Bacillus thuringiensis*)** spray — the organic gardener's best weapon against caterpillars. Apply weekly on affected crops. Kills only caterpillars, harmless to everything else.
- Parasitic wasps (the tiny braconid wasps that lay eggs on hornworms — if you see a hornworm covered in white cocoons, leave it — those wasps are working for you)

### 4. Squash Vine Borers

**Damage:** Larvae bore into squash and pumpkin stems, causing sudden wilting and plant death.

**Target crops:** Summer squash, zucchini, some winter squash (*C. pepo* and *C. maxima* types). Note: *C. moschata* types (butternut, Seminole pumpkin) are resistant.

**Management:**
- Grow *moschata* varieties (see Chapter 17)
- Wrap stem bases with aluminum foil or nylon stocking to prevent egg-laying
- Inject Bt into stem if you catch borers early (slit stem, inject, tape closed)
- Succession-plant summer squash — plan for plants to be killed, and have replacements ready

### 5. Leaf-Footed Bugs and Stink Bugs

**Damage:** Pierce-suck damage on tomatoes, peppers, and beans causes dimpled, discolored fruit.

**Target crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, beans, citrus

**Management:**
- Hand-pick adults (they're large and slow)
- Remove egg clusters from leaf undersides
- Neem oil or pyrethrin spray for heavy infestations
- Clean up garden debris where they overwinter

### 6. Spider Mites

**Damage:** Microscopic arachnids that suck plant juices, causing stippled, bronzed leaves and fine webbing.

**Target crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, beans, strawberries — almost anything during hot, dry periods

**Management:**
- Strong water spray on leaf undersides every 2–3 days (they hate moisture)
- Neem oil or insecticidal soap, focusing on undersides of leaves
- Predatory mites (*Phytoseiulus persimilis*) — fight mites with mites. Nature is metal.
- Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that kill the predators keeping spider mites in check
- Keep plants well-watered — stressed plants are spider mite magnets

### 7. Root-Knot Nematodes

**Damage:** Microscopic roundworms that cause gall-like swellings on roots, stunting growth, and reducing yields. This is the silent assassin of Florida gardening — you might not even know they're there until you pull up a plant and see roots that look like they swallowed a string of pearls.

**Target crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, okra, squash, lettuce, carrots — virtually everything

**Management:**
- Soil solarization in summer (see "Season Extension" chapter)
- Plant marigolds (*Tagetes* spp.) as a cover crop — they produce compounds toxic to nematodes. Not just pretty faces!
- Grow resistant varieties (look for "N" in the disease resistance codes on tomato labels — VFN means Verticillium, Fusarium, and Nematode resistance)
- Add **organic matter** generously — healthy soil biology competes with nematodes
- Rotate with nematode-resistant crops: brassicas, corn, and alliums
- **Mustard cover crops** (turned under as green manure) release biofumigant compounds

### 8. Slugs and Snails

**Damage:** Irregular holes chewed in leaves and fruit, slimy trails on everything. They're basically tiny gastropod vandals with a buffet problem.

**Target crops:** Lettuce, strawberries, seedlings of all types, low-growing herbs

**Management:**
- Iron phosphate bait (Sluggo) — organic and safe around pets and wildlife
- Beer traps (bury a cup rim-level in soil, fill halfway with cheap beer — they crawl in and... well, there are worse ways to go)
- Hand-pick at night with a headlamp (yes, this is what Florida gardening has come to)
- Reduce mulch near susceptible crops temporarily — slugs love hiding in mulch
- Copper tape around raised bed edges creates a barrier they won't cross

### 9. Leafminers

**Damage:** Serpentine trails or blotches inside leaves where larvae tunnel between leaf surfaces. Looks like a toddler took a white pen to your plants.

**Target crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, beans, beets, spinach, chard

**Management:**
- Remove and destroy affected leaves
- Parasitic wasps naturally control populations — avoid broad-spectrum sprays
- Floating row covers to prevent adult flies from laying eggs
- Neem oil as a deterrent spray
- Cosmetic damage is often tolerable — plants usually outgrow light infestations

### 10. Fire Ants

**Damage:** While not directly plant pests, fire ants colonize garden beds, make harvesting miserable, and can girdle young transplant stems. Plus, you know, *they sting like they're personally offended by your existence.*

**Management:**
- Spinosad-based bait (organic option) applied around mound perimeters
- Boiling water poured directly on mounds (3–4 gallons per mound, satisfying but temporary)
- Beneficial nematodes (*Steinernema carpocapsae*) watered into mounds
- Keep baiting consistently — they will come back. It's Florida. They always come back.

## Common Diseases in the Florida Garden

Florida's humidity is a petri dish for plant diseases. Good cultural practices prevent 90% of problems.

### Fungal Diseases

**1. Early Blight (*Alternaria solani*)**
- **Symptoms:** Dark concentric ring ("target") spots on lower leaves, progressing upward
- **Crops:** Tomatoes, potatoes
- **Prevention:** Mulch to prevent soil splash, prune lower branches, rotate crops
- **Treatment:** Copper fungicide, chlorothalonil (conventional)

**2. Late Blight (*Phytophthora infestans*)**
- **Symptoms:** Water-soaked spots on leaves that rapidly turn brown/black; white fuzzy growth on undersides in humid weather. This is the disease that caused the Irish Potato Famine, and yes, it's in Florida.
- **Crops:** Tomatoes, potatoes
- **Prevention:** Resistant varieties, good air circulation, avoid overhead watering
- **Treatment:** Copper fungicide preventively; remove and destroy affected plants (do NOT compost)

**3. Powdery Mildew**
- **Symptoms:** White powdery coating on leaves. Looks exactly like what it sounds like.
- **Crops:** Squash, cucumbers, melons, peas, beans
- **Prevention:** Resistant varieties, good spacing for air circulation
- **Treatment:** Neem oil, potassium bicarbonate spray, sulfur (avoid in temps above 90°F)

**4. Downy Mildew**
- **Symptoms:** Yellow patches on leaf tops with grayish-purple fuzz underneath. Not the same as powdery mildew — downy is actually an oomycete (water mold), not a true fungus. Yes, this matters. No, your plants don't care about taxonomy.
- **Crops:** Lettuce, basil, cucurbits, spinach
- **Prevention:** Morning watering, drip irrigation, resistant varieties (especially for basil — look for 'Amazel' or 'Prospera' types)
- **Treatment:** Copper fungicide; remove affected plants in severe cases

**5. Fusarium and Verticillium Wilt**
- **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting on one side of the plant; brown discoloration inside stems when cut
- **Crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, watermelon, strawberries
- **Prevention:** Resistant varieties (the "VF" on your tomato label), crop rotation, soil solarization
- **Treatment:** No cure once infected — remove and destroy plants. Prevention is everything.

**6. Anthracnose**
- **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on fruits; can also cause leaf spots
- **Crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, beans, cucurbits, strawberries
- **Prevention:** Avoid overhead watering, rotate crops, harvest promptly
- **Treatment:** Copper fungicide preventively

### Bacterial Diseases

**1. Bacterial Wilt**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden, dramatic wilting with no yellowing; stems ooze milky sap when cut and placed in water
- **Crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes
- **Prevention:** Resistant rootstock grafting, crop rotation (3+ years away from solanaceous crops)
- **Treatment:** None. Remove and destroy. Control the cucumber beetles that spread it.

**2. Bacterial Spot/Speck**
- **Symptoms:** Small, dark, angular spots on leaves and raised, scabby spots on fruit
- **Crops:** Tomatoes, peppers
- **Prevention:** Clean seed, copper sprays preventively, avoid working in wet gardens
- **Treatment:** Copper + mancozeb spray programs; remove severely affected plants

### Viral Diseases

**Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)**
- **Symptoms:** Upward curling, yellowing leaves; stunted growth; reduced fruit set
- **Vector:** Whiteflies (silverleaf whitefly specifically)
- **Crops:** Tomatoes primarily
- **Prevention:** Resistant varieties, reflective mulch to repel whiteflies, row covers on transplants
- **Treatment:** No cure. Control whiteflies, remove infected plants promptly.

**Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV)**
- **Symptoms:** Mottled, mosaic-patterned leaves; distorted growth; reduced yields
- **Vector:** Aphids
- **Crops:** Cucurbits, peppers, tomatoes, beans, lettuce
- **Prevention:** Aphid control, resistant varieties, remove infected plants
- **Treatment:** No cure. Manage the aphids, remove symptomatic plants.

### The Florida Gardener's Disease Prevention Checklist

1. **Water at the base, never overhead** — drip irrigation is your best disease-prevention tool
2. **Mulch everything** — prevents soil splash that spreads fungal spores
3. **Space plants properly** — air circulation is medicine
4. **Rotate crops** — never plant the same family in the same spot two years running
5. **Choose resistant varieties** — Florida-adapted varieties exist for a reason
6. **Clean your tools** — wipe pruners with rubbing alcohol between plants when dealing with disease
7. **Remove sick plants promptly** — don't let them become disease factories
8. **Don't compost diseased material** — bag it and trash it
9. **Water in the morning** — leaves dry during the day instead of sitting wet overnight
10. **Build healthy soil** — compost, organic matter, and biological diversity in the soil suppress disease naturally

# Chapter 20: Companion Planting & Crop Rotation

## The Art and Science of Good Neighbors

Companion planting is part science, part tradition, and part "my grandmother swore by it." Some combinations have solid research behind them; others have centuries of anecdotal evidence and a shrug from the agricultural extension office. We'll share both, and you can experiment in your own garden.

The core idea is simple: some plants help each other out (through pest deterrence, pollinator attraction, nutrient sharing, or physical support), and some plants actively sabotage each other (through chemical inhibition, resource competition, or shared pest attraction).

Think of it as seating arrangements at a dinner party. Put the right guests together and conversation flows. Put the wrong ones together and someone's leaving early.

## Proven Beneficial Combinations

### The Three Sisters (Florida Edition)

The classic Native American trio of corn, beans, and squash works beautifully in Florida — but with timing adjustments. Plant corn first, let it reach 6 inches, then add pole beans and sprawling squash. The corn supports the beans, the beans fix nitrogen for the corn, and the squash shades the ground (suppressing weeds and retaining moisture).

**Florida modifications:**
- Plant in early spring (March in North Florida, February in Central, January in South)
- Use Seminole pumpkin as your squash — it's adapted, vigorous, and nematode-resistant
- Consider adding sunflowers at the edges for additional pollinator support and trap cropping

### Tomatoes and Basil

This isn't just a culinary pairing — basil genuinely helps tomatoes. Research suggests basil can repel certain pests (thrips, possibly whiteflies) and may improve tomato flavor. At minimum, you're making efficient use of space by interplanting a low-growing herb under a tall crop.

**Expand the combination:**
- Add marigolds around the tomato bed perimeter (nematode suppression, whitefly confusion)
- Interplant with parsley or cilantro to attract beneficial wasps
- Avoid planting dill near tomatoes (mature dill may inhibit tomato growth)

### Brassicas and Alliums

Onions, garlic, and chives planted among broccoli, cabbage, and kale help confuse and repel cabbage moths, aphids, and other brassica pests with their strong scent.

**Florida tip:** Plant green onions or chives as a permanent border around your brassica bed. They'll come back year after year (chives are perennial even in Florida) and continuously provide pest-confusing aromatics.

### Peppers and Spinach/Lettuce

Tall pepper plants provide afternoon shade for cool-season greens, extending their productive life into warming spring weather. This vertical layering is especially valuable in Florida where the window for lettuce is brutally short.

### Corn and Cucumbers

Cucumbers love the partial shade that corn provides during hot afternoons. Train cucumbers to grow up corn stalks or on trellises between corn rows for efficient space use.

### Beans and Potatoes

Bush beans fix nitrogen that potatoes appreciate, and the two don't compete for the same soil nutrients. The beans also help deter Colorado potato beetles (less common in Florida, but still possible in northern zones).

### Radishes as Trap Crops

Radishes are the sacrificial lambs of the garden. Plant them near squash to lure flea beetles away from your main crop. Plant them near brassicas to attract cabbage root flies. Radishes grow fast and cheap — losing a few to protect your prized crops is a worthy trade.

### Marigolds — The Universal Companion

French marigolds (*Tagetes patula*) deserve a spot in every Florida vegetable garden:
- Suppress root-knot nematodes (plant densely as a cover crop, then turn under)
- Attract beneficial insects
- Repel whiteflies when planted near tomatoes
- Add cheerful color that makes your garden look intentional even when it's chaos

## Combinations to Avoid

Not all plants play well together. Here are the most important conflicts:

| Keep Apart | Reason |
|---|---|
| Tomatoes & fennel | Fennel inhibits growth of most vegetables |
| Beans & alliums (onions, garlic) | Alliums may stunt bean growth |
| Potatoes & tomatoes | Same family — share diseases and pests |
| Cucumbers & aromatic herbs (sage, mint) | May reduce cucumber vigor |
| Peppers & fennel | Same allelopathic issues as tomatoes |
| Dill (mature) & tomatoes | Mature dill may inhibit tomato growth |
| Brassicas & strawberries | Compete heavily; brassicas may inhibit strawberry growth |
| Sunflowers & pole beans | Sunflowers release allelopathic compounds that affect beans |

**A note on allelopathy:** Some plants release chemicals from their roots or decomposing leaves that inhibit other plants' growth. Black walnut trees are the famous example (their juglone kills tomatoes), but fennel, sunflowers, and even some brassica residues can have mild allelopathic effects. It's not poison — it's just plants being territorial. Relatable, honestly.

## Companion Planting Quick Reference for Florida's Top Crops

**Tomatoes:** Plant with basil, marigolds, carrots, parsley, chives. Avoid fennel, mature dill, brassicas, potatoes.

**Peppers:** Plant with basil, tomatoes, carrots, onions, spinach. Avoid fennel, kohlrabi.

**Squash/Cucumbers:** Plant with corn, beans, radishes, marigolds, nasturtiums. Avoid potatoes, aromatic herbs.

**Beans:** Plant with corn, squash, potatoes, carrots, cucumbers. Avoid onions, garlic, fennel.

**Brassicas:** Plant with onions, garlic, chives, dill (young), beets, celery. Avoid strawberries, tomatoes, pole beans.

**Lettuce/Greens:** Plant with carrots, radishes, strawberries, chives, tall crops for shade. Avoid — few true conflicts; greens are easygoing neighbors.

**Sweet Potatoes:** Plant with beans, corn, summer savory. Avoid — they're vigorous enough to outcompete most neighbors on their own.

## Crop Rotation: The Four-Year Dance

Crop rotation is not optional in Florida. Our warm, moist soils build up pest and disease populations faster than cooler climates, and our year-round growing means we can cycle through rotations faster too.

### Why Rotate?

1. **Disease prevention** — Most soilborne pathogens affect specific plant families. Moving crops breaks the cycle.
2. **Nematode management** — Different nematode species target different crops. Rotation starves them out.
3. **Nutrient balancing** — Heavy feeders followed by light feeders followed by nitrogen-fixers keeps soil balanced.
4. **Pest disruption** — Many pests overwinter in soil near their host plants. Moving the crop moves the buffet.

### The Four-Family Rotation

Divide your crops into four groups based on plant family and nutrient needs:

**Group 1: Solanaceae + Heavy Feeders**
Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes
- Heavy feeders — amend soil generously before planting
- Susceptible to similar diseases (fusarium, bacterial wilt, nematodes)
- Never follow each other

**Group 2: Cucurbits + Moderate Feeders**
Squash, cucumbers, melons, watermelons, pumpkins
- Moderate to heavy feeders
- Share powdery mildew, downy mildew, and some viral diseases
- Vine borers and cucumber beetles follow this group

**Group 3: Legumes + Light Feeders**
Beans, peas, southern peas (cowpeas)
- Fix nitrogen — they GIVE nutrients to the soil
- Plant after heavy feeders to replenish nitrogen
- Few shared diseases with other groups

**Group 4: Brassicas, Root Crops + Alliums**
Broccoli, cabbage, kale, collards, turnips, radishes, carrots, beets, onions, garlic
- Moderate feeders
- Brassicas are somewhat resistant to root-knot nematodes
- Good "cleanup" crew before solanaceous crops

### The Rotation Sequence

**Year 1, Bed A:** Group 1 (Tomatoes/Peppers)
**Year 2, Bed A:** Group 2 (Squash/Cucumbers)
**Year 3, Bed A:** Group 3 (Beans/Peas)
**Year 4, Bed A:** Group 4 (Brassicas/Root Crops)
**Year 5, Bed A:** Back to Group 1

Each bed follows the same sequence, just starting at a different point. With four beds, you have all four groups growing every season.

### Florida-Specific Rotation Tips

- **Double-cropping accelerates rotation.** Since Florida has two main growing seasons (fall/winter cool-season crops plus spring/summer warm-season crops), you can get through a rotation faster. Plant tomatoes (Group 1) in spring, followed by broccoli (Group 4) in fall — that's two groups in one year.
- **Summer cover crops count.** Plant cowpeas or sunn hemp during the brutal summer months when few vegetables thrive. They fix nitrogen, suppress nematodes, and add organic matter when turned under.
- **Solarize between rotations.** Clear plastic over fallow beds in June–August uses Florida's intense sun to cook soilborne pathogens and nematodes.
- **Keep records.** A simple garden journal or phone photo of each bed each season makes rotation planning effortless. Future-you will thank present-you.

# Chapter 21: Season Extension & Heat Protection

## Stretching the Calendar in Both Directions

Florida gardeners face a unique season-extension challenge. In most of the country, "season extension" means keeping plants alive through cold weather. In Florida, our bigger enemy is heat. Yes, we need frost protection occasionally (especially in North and Central Florida), but the real art is extending the growing season *into and through the summer furnace*.

Think of Florida's growing challenges as a sandwich: cold snaps on the top, nuclear heat on the bottom, and your productive growing season is the delicious filling in between. Our job is to make that filling as thick as possible.

## Cold Protection (November–March)

### Know Your Frost Dates

- **North Florida (8b–9a):** First frost mid-November to early December; last frost mid-March
- **Central Florida (9b–10a):** First frost mid-December; last frost mid-February (sporadic and light)
- **South Florida (10b–11a):** Frost is rare but not impossible — maybe once every few years, usually just a near-miss

### Frost Protection Methods

**Floating row covers (frost blankets):** The single best investment for Florida cool-season gardening. Lightweight fabric draped over hoops or directly on plants provides 4–8°F of frost protection. That's usually enough for everything except a hard freeze.

- Use 1.0–1.5 oz/sq yd weight for frost protection
- Lighter weights (0.5 oz) work for pest exclusion without much temperature benefit
- Secure edges with soil, bricks, or clips — wind is the enemy of row covers in Florida
- Remove during the day when temps exceed 80°F to prevent overheating

**Christmas lights and water jugs:** Old-school but effective. Strings of incandescent C9 lights (not LED — you want the heat) draped under row cover add several degrees of warmth. Gallon jugs filled with water and placed among plants absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night.

**Mulch banking:** For root crops, strawberries, and low-growing plants, mound mulch up around the base before a freeze. The mulch insulates the root zone even if top growth is damaged.

**Cold frames and mini hoop houses:** PVC hoops covered with 6-mil greenhouse plastic create warm microclimates for winter growing. Open the ends on warm days for ventilation — Florida winter sun can cook plants inside a sealed hoop house by 10 AM.

**The bucket method:** For individual tender plants (young citrus, tropical herbs), an inverted 5-gallon bucket placed over the plant and weighted down provides surprisingly good frost protection for a single night. Add a trouble light underneath for extra warmth.

### What to Do After a Freeze

1. **Don't prune immediately.** Damaged tissue actually insulates the interior from further cold. Wait until new growth emerges (usually 2–4 weeks) to see what's truly dead.
2. **Water the soil before a predicted freeze** — moist soil holds and releases more heat than dry soil.
3. **Assess and replant.** Cool-season crops have time to recover or be replanted through February (North Florida) or March (Central). Florida's long season means one freeze rarely ends the game.

## Heat Protection (May–September)

This is where Florida gardening gets creative. Temperatures above 95°F with high humidity shut down most vegetable production. Tomatoes drop blossoms above 90°F. Lettuce bolts at the first whiff of summer. Even heat-loving peppers and eggplant slow dramatically in true Florida summer.

### Shade Cloth: Your Summer Survival Tool

Shade cloth is to summer what frost blankets are to winter — essential infrastructure.

**Types and percentages:**
- **30% shade:** Light filtering. Good for tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant that need some relief but still want plenty of light.
- **50% shade:** The sweet spot for most summer gardening. Lettuce, herbs, and greens can survive well into May and restart in August under 50% shade.
- **70% shade:** Heavy filtering. Best for ultra-heat-sensitive crops or nursery areas for starting fall transplants in summer.

**Installation tips:**
- Mount on a frame at least 12 inches above crop canopy for air circulation
- Shade cloth on the west and south sides of beds is more important than overhead coverage
- Aluminet (reflective shade cloth) reduces temperatures more effectively than standard black shade cloth
- Remove shade cloth when temperatures moderate in fall — your winter crops want full sun

### Soil Solarization: Turning Summer Into an Advantage

Here's the beautiful irony of Florida summer: while it's too hot to grow most crops, it's the perfect time to sterilize your soil using that very same heat.

**How to solarize:**
1. Clear the bed of all plant material and debris
2. Water the soil thoroughly (moist soil conducts heat better)
3. Cover with **clear plastic** (not black — clear creates a greenhouse effect, reaching higher temperatures). Use 1–2 mil painter's plastic or dedicated solarization film.
4. Seal the edges by burying them in soil or weighting with boards
5. Leave in place for **6–8 weeks** during June–August (the hotter months)
6. Soil temperatures will reach 130–140°F at the surface and 100–120°F at 6-inch depth

**What solarization kills:**
- Root-knot nematodes (significantly reduced)
- Fusarium and other soilborne fungal pathogens
- Many weed seeds in the top few inches
- Various soil-dwelling pests and larvae

**What it doesn't kill:**
- Beneficial organisms recover faster than pathogens (they're more diverse and resilient)
- Deep-dwelling organisms below 8 inches
- All weed seeds (some survive; it's a reduction, not elimination)

**Pro tip:** After removing the solarization plastic, immediately add compost and plant a cover crop or your fall vegetables. The "biological vacuum" left by solarization is best filled with beneficial organisms from good compost before pathogens can recolonize.

### Summer Cover Crops: Productive Resting

If you're not solarizing, plant a summer cover crop to keep beds productive even when you can't grow vegetables:

**Sunn hemp (*Crotalaria juncea*):** Florida's summer superstar cover crop. Grows 6+ feet tall in 60 days, fixes nitrogen like crazy, suppresses nematodes, and adds massive organic matter when turned under. Seeds are readily available from Southern Exposure, Johnny's, and Florida seed suppliers.

**Cowpeas/Southern peas (*Vigna unguiculata*):** Dual purpose — harvest some for eating, let the rest grow as a cover crop. Fixes nitrogen, tolerates Florida summer with zero complaints, and the flowers attract pollinators.

**Buckwheat:** Fast-growing (30 days to flower), excellent pollinator plant, and mines phosphorus from the soil. Plant in succession — it's killed by hard frost, so use as a transition crop from spring to fall.

**Iron clay peas:** A specific cowpea variety bred for cover cropping. Extremely nematode-suppressive, heat-tolerant, and vigorous. The University of Florida recommends this one specifically for nematode management.

### Microclimate Management

Beyond shade cloth and solarization, you can create favorable microclimates through smart garden design:

**Windbreaks:** A hedge of Simpson stopper, wax myrtle, or even a row of tall sunn hemp can buffer hot, desiccating winds. Position on the west side of your garden where afternoon heat and wind are fiercest.

**East-facing beds:** Orient beds to catch morning sun and receive afternoon shade from buildings, fences, or trees. Morning light is cooler and gentler — plants photosynthesize efficiently without the heat stress of western afternoon sun.

**Deep mulch:** In summer, 4–6 inches of mulch keeps soil temperatures 10–15°F cooler than bare soil. This alone extends root activity and plant vigor. Pine straw, wood chips, and shredded leaves all work. Apply everywhere you're not solarizing.

**Drip irrigation with timers:** Consistent soil moisture prevents heat stress compounding into water stress. Water early morning (before 8 AM) to reduce evaporation and give foliage time to dry before nightfall. Twice-daily watering may be necessary in sandy soils during peak summer.

**The living shade approach:** Grow trellised crops (pole beans, loofahs, passion fruit, Malabar spinach) on the south and west sides of more tender crops. The living trellis provides productive shade — you're harvesting from your shade structure.

### Florida's Summer-Viable Crops

Don't give up on summer entirely. These crops actually thrive in Florida's brutal heat:

- **Sweet potatoes** — plant in April/May, harvest in fall. They LOVE summer.
- **Seminole pumpkin** — the indestructible Florida native. Plant and forget.
- **Southern peas** (black-eyed peas, crowder peas, zipper cream) — heat is their happy place
- **Okra** — grows taller and more productive the hotter it gets
- **Malabar spinach** — a heat-loving vine that substitutes for true spinach in summer
- **Calabaza** (Cuban squash) — tropical squash that thrives when all other squash have surrendered
- **Katuk** — perennial tropical green, one of the most nutritious vegetables on Earth
- **Moringa** — tropical "miracle tree" that grows like a weed and produces edible leaves all summer
- **Roselle (Florida cranberry)** — hibiscus relative; the calyxes make incredible jam and tea
- **Long beans (asparagus beans)** — heat-tolerant Asian bean that produces prolifically through summer
- **Luffa gourd** — grow your own sponges while shading other crops. Peak Florida multitasking.

## Glossary of Florida Gardening Terms

**Allelopathy:** The chemical inhibition of one plant by another through root exudates or decomposing material. Fennel and black walnut are classic examples.

**Bolt/Bolting:** When a plant prematurely sends up a flower stalk, usually due to heat or long days. Common in lettuce, cilantro, and spinach. The plant is basically saying, "I'm done here."

**Chill hours:** Hours of temperatures between 32–45°F accumulated during winter. Important for deciduous fruit trees and some vegetables like garlic. North Florida gets 400–600+ chill hours; South Florida gets almost none.

**Cover crop:** A crop grown not for harvest but for soil improvement — nitrogen fixation, organic matter, nematode suppression, or erosion prevention.

**Days to maturity (DTM):** Time from transplanting (or seeding, check the packet) to first harvest. In Florida's warmth, actual DTM is often shorter than listed on seed packets.

**Determinate (tomato):** A tomato variety that grows to a fixed size, sets fruit all at once, and then declines. Good for canning, small spaces, and container growing.

**Drip line:** The outer edge of a plant's canopy where rain drips off. Feeder roots often concentrate at the drip line — a good place to apply fertilizer and amendments.

**Extension office:** Your county's University of Florida IFAS Extension office. Staffed by actual scientists who give free, research-based, Florida-specific gardening advice. Seriously, call them. They're wonderful.

**Floating row cover:** Lightweight fabric (spunbond polypropylene) draped over crops for frost protection and/or pest exclusion. Lets in light, water, and air.

**Green manure:** A cover crop that's tilled into the soil before it goes to seed, adding organic matter and nutrients as it decomposes.

**Hardening off:** Gradually acclimating indoor-grown transplants to outdoor conditions over 5–7 days. Skipping this step is how you assassinate perfectly healthy seedlings.

**Indeterminate (tomato):** A tomato variety that grows, fruits, and vines continuously until killed by heat, cold, or disease. Needs staking/caging. Most heirloom varieties are indeterminate.

**Microclimate:** A small area with climate conditions different from the surrounding area. South-facing walls, low spots that collect frost, shaded areas — all microclimates. Learning your garden's microclimates is a Florida superpower.

**Nematode:** A microscopic roundworm. Root-knot nematodes are the primary pest nematode in Florida gardens. Beneficial nematodes also exist and can be purchased for pest control.

**N-P-K:** The three numbers on fertilizer labels representing Nitrogen (growth), Phosphorus (roots/flowers), and Potassium (overall health/disease resistance). A 10-10-10 fertilizer contains 10% each.

**pH:** A measure of soil acidity/alkalinity on a scale of 0–14. Most vegetables prefer 6.0–7.0. Florida soils vary wildly — sandy soils tend acidic, limestone-derived soils (South Florida) tend alkaline.

**Side-dress:** Applying fertilizer alongside growing plants during the season, rather than only at planting time. Especially important in Florida's sandy soils where nutrients leach quickly.

**Solarization:** Using clear plastic over moist soil during summer to raise soil temperatures high enough to kill pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.

**Succession planting:** Planting the same crop every 2–3 weeks for a continuous harvest rather than one big glut. Essential for beans, lettuce, radishes, and corn.

**Transplant shock:** The stress plants experience when moved from pot to garden. Minimized by hardening off, watering well, and transplanting in late afternoon or on cloudy days.

## Quick Reference: Seed Spacing and Depth Cheat Sheet

Keep this in your garden shed or saved on your phone. When you're standing in the garden with seeds in hand and can't remember if carrots go a quarter-inch or a half-inch deep, this is your friend.

**General rule of thumb:** Plant seeds at a depth of 2–3 times their diameter. Tiny seeds (lettuce, carrots) get barely covered. Large seeds (beans, corn) go an inch or more deep.

| Crop | Seed Depth | Plant Spacing | Row Spacing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beans (bush) | 1 inch | 4–6 inches | 18–24 inches |
| Beans (pole) | 1 inch | 6 inches | 36 inches |
| Beets | ½ inch | 3–4 inches | 12 inches |
| Broccoli (transplant) | — | 18 inches | 24–36 inches |
| Cabbage (transplant) | — | 12–18 inches | 24–36 inches |
| Carrots | ¼ inch | 2–3 inches | 12 inches |
| Corn | 1–2 inches | 10–12 inches | 30–36 inches |
| Cucumbers | 1 inch | 12 inches | 48–60 inches |
| Eggplant (transplant) | — | 18–24 inches | 30–36 inches |
| Kale | ½ inch | 12–18 inches | 18–24 inches |
| Lettuce | ¼ inch | 6–12 inches | 12 inches |
| Okra | 1 inch | 12–18 inches | 36 inches |
| Onions (sets) | 1 inch | 4–6 inches | 12 inches |

| Squash (summer) | 1 inch | 24 inches | 48–60 inches |
| Squash (winter) | 1 inch | 36 inches | 72 inches |
| Sweet Potatoes (slips) | — | 12 inches | 36 inches |
| Tomatoes (transplant) | — | 24–36 inches | 36–48 inches |

## Final Words: The Florida Gardening Mindset

If you've made it this far, congratulations — you now know more about Florida vegetable gardening than 95% of people who live here. But knowledge without action is just trivia, and the best garden is the one you actually plant.

Here are the truths that every experienced Florida gardener eventually learns:

**1. The calendar is everything.** Timing matters more in Florida than almost anywhere else. Plant at the right time and mediocre effort produces great results. Plant at the wrong time and heroic effort produces disappointment. When in doubt, check the planting calendars in this chapter and your extension office's recommendations.

**2. Soil is the foundation.** Florida's native sand is a growing medium, not a growing *miracle*. The single most impactful thing you can do is add organic matter — compost, cover crops, mulch, worm castings — continuously and generously. Every year, your soil gets better. Every year, gardening gets easier.

**3. Water is non-negotiable.** Drip irrigation on a timer transforms Florida gardening from a daily chore into a weekly pleasure. The investment pays for itself in water savings, reduced disease, and your own sanity.

**4. Failure is curriculum.** Every Florida gardener has lost an entire bed to nematodes, watched their tomatoes succumb to late blight, or planted two weeks too late and watched everything bolt. These aren't failures — they're tuition payments in the University of Your Garden. Take notes, adjust, and try again next season.

**5. Start small, grow steadily.** Four raised beds, well-maintained, will produce more food and more joy than twenty beds you can't keep up with. Add a bed or a technique each season. In three years, you'll be the person your neighbors come to for advice.

**6. Share the harvest.** You will, at some point, have more tomatoes or squash or beans than you can eat. This is a feature, not a bug. Share with neighbors, donate to food banks, trade with other gardeners. Food grown and shared builds community in ways that almost nothing else can.

**7. Enjoy the weirdness.** Florida gardening is unlike gardening anywhere else. We grow tomatoes in winter and sweet potatoes in summer. We fight alligators for our watermelons (okay, maybe not, but it feels that way sometimes). We garden in sand, in limestone, in muck, in raised beds full of store-bought soil because we gave up on the native stuff. We deal with hurricanes, nematodes, fire ants, and humidity that fogs our glasses the moment we step outside.

And we love it. Every weird, sweaty, bug-bitten minute of it.

Welcome to Florida vegetable gardening. Now go get your hands dirty.
