# Part I: Getting Started in Northern California

# Chapter 1: Why Northern California Is Different

You live in one of the most extraordinary gardening regions on the planet. That's not hype — it's geography. Northern California's Mediterranean climate gives you something most American gardeners can only fantasize about: mild, wet winters and long, warm, dry summers. The kind of weather that grows world-class wine grapes, stone fruits, and tomatoes that actually taste like tomatoes.

But here's where it gets complicated. Within a 90-minute drive, you can go from a fog-blanketed coastal ridge where summer highs struggle to reach 65°F, to an inland valley where the thermometer hits 108°F and the air smells like dried grass. You can be in USDA Zone 10a at sea level in San Francisco and Zone 7a in the Sierra Foothills — and both gardeners are technically in "Northern California."

That's why generic West Coast gardening books don't cut it here. That's why this book exists.

## The Mediterranean Climate: Your Superpower (and Your Constraint)

Northern California has a **Mediterranean climate** — one of only five regions in the world with this pattern. The signature: nearly all precipitation falls between October and April, and summers are almost completely dry.

This creates two realities you need to internalize:

1. **Water is everything.** In Dallas or Atlanta, the sky waters your garden for free all summer. Here? You might go June through October without a single drop of rain. Every ounce of irrigation water is on you.

2. **You can grow year-round.** While gardeners in the Midwest stare at frozen ground from November to March, you can be harvesting lettuce, kale, peas, and fava beans through the winter. Most of NorCal never sees temperatures cold enough to stop cool-season crops entirely.

This is the fundamental trade: endless growing season, but you provide the water. Master that equation and you'll out-produce gardeners with twice your square footage in rainier climates.

## Northern California's Four Growing Regions

Throughout this book, every planting date, variety pick, and strategy is keyed to one of four distinct regions. Find yours.

### Bay Area (USDA Zones 9b–10a)

**Last spring frost:** Rarely frosts at all in most areas; January 15–February 15 in colder inland valleys  
**First fall frost:** December 1–January 1 (if at all)

The Bay Area is really a dozen microclimates stitched together. The fog belt — San Francisco, Pacifica, Half Moon Bay, coastal Marin — stays cool year-round, with summer highs often in the 60s. Tomatoes struggle here without variety selection and warm-microclimate tricks. Meanwhile, Walnut Creek, Livermore, and the inland East Bay valleys bake in triple-digit heat that rivals Sacramento.

The marine influence is the defining variable. If you can see fog from your garden, you're in a different growing world than someone 20 miles inland.

**Your advantages:** Nearly frost-free winters, incredible year-round growing potential, moderate temperatures that extend crop life.

**Your challenges:** Fog and cool summers on the coast, microclimates that change block-by-block, expensive water, and small lots that limit space.

### Sacramento Valley (USDA Zones 9a–9b)

**Last spring frost:** February 15–March 1  
**First fall frost:** November 15–December 1

The Sacramento Valley is NorCal's breadbasket — flat, fertile, and hot. This is where rice paddies and almond orchards stretch to the horizon, and for good reason. The valley floor gets 270+ frost-free days and enough heat units to ripen anything that grows in North America.

From Sacramento to Chico, Redding to Stockton, the valley shares a common personality: blazing summers (30+ days above 100°F in a typical year), tule fog in winter, and rich alluvial soil deposited over millennia by the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

**Your advantages:** Long, hot growing season ideal for warm-season crops, fertile soil, affordable land and water (relative to the Bay Area).

**Your challenges:** Extreme summer heat that shuts down many crops from July to mid-August, tule fog that slows winter growth, and the ever-present reality of drought and water restrictions.

### Wine Country (USDA Zones 8b–10a)

**Last spring frost:** March 1–15 (varies dramatically by elevation and valley)  
**First fall frost:** November 1–December 1

Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino, and Lake Counties — "Wine Country" is marketing shorthand for a patchwork of valleys, ridges, and coastal-influenced slopes that defy simple classification. The valley floors of Napa and Sonoma can be as hot as Sacramento in summer, while the ridgetops and western slopes feel the ocean's cooling hand.

What the wine industry discovered — that a vineyard on one side of a hill produces completely different results from one on the other side — applies directly to your vegetable garden. Aspect (which direction your slope faces), elevation, and proximity to gaps in the coastal hills all matter enormously.

**Your advantages:** Rich soil in valley floors, long growing seasons, enough heat for warm-season crops, strong local food culture with farmers' markets everywhere.

**Your challenges:** Fire season (more on this in Chapter 4), variable microclimates, deer pressure that's genuinely legendary, and water availability in rural areas.

### Sierra Foothills (USDA Zones 7a–9a)

**Last spring frost:** March 15–April 15 (elevation dependent)  
**First fall frost:** October 15–November 15

From the oak-studded hills of El Dorado and Amador Counties to the pine forests of Nevada City and the northern Sierra, the Foothills region is where Mediterranean California transitions into mountain climate. At 1,500 feet, you're in a different world than the valley floor below. At 3,500 feet, you're in yet another.

Elevation is king here. Every 1,000 feet of elevation gain costs you roughly 3–5°F in average temperature and 2–3 weeks of growing season. A gardener in Auburn (1,300 ft) has a significantly different calendar than one in Grass Valley (2,400 ft).

**Your advantages:** Cooler summers that don't punish heat-sensitive crops, excellent drainage on slopes, beautiful growing conditions for cool-season crops, lower deer pressure than Wine Country (marginally).

**Your challenges:** Shorter growing season, genuine frost risk, rocky and often shallow soil, fire danger (this is ground zero for California wildfire), and the challenge of gardening on slopes.

## Average Frost Dates and Growing Season by Region

| Region | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Frost-Free Days |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Bay Area (coastal) | Rarely frosts | Rarely frosts | 340–365 |
| Bay Area (inland valleys) | Jan 15–Feb 15 | Dec 1–Jan 1 | 300–340 |
| Sacramento Valley | Feb 15–Mar 1 | Nov 15–Dec 1 | 260–285 |
| Wine Country (valley floor) | Mar 1–15 | Nov 1–Dec 1 | 240–270 |
| Wine Country (ridgetops) | Mar 15–Apr 1 | Oct 15–Nov 15 | 200–240 |
| Sierra Foothills (1,500 ft) | Mar 15–Apr 1 | Nov 1–15 | 220–240 |
| Sierra Foothills (2,500 ft) | Apr 1–15 | Oct 15–Nov 1 | 185–210 |
| Sierra Foothills (3,500 ft) | Apr 15–May 1 | Oct 1–15 | 165–185 |

These are averages. Your specific microclimate can shift them two weeks in either direction. More on microclimates in Chapter 3.

## Two Seasons, Three Strategies

NorCal gardeners have three distinct growing strategies that overlap throughout the year:

**Cool-Season Planting (October through March):** This is when the rain does the work for you. Peas, fava beans, lettuce, brassicas, root vegetables — all thrive in NorCal's mild, wet winters. In the Bay Area and lower Sacramento Valley, this is arguably the easiest and most productive gardening season.

**Warm-Season Planting (March through June):** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, corn — everything that needs heat goes in once frost risk passes and soil temperatures climb. The Sacramento Valley and inland Bay Area valleys have enough heat units to rival anywhere in the country.

**The Summer Dead Zone (mid-July through mid-August):** In the Sacramento Valley and hot inland areas, extreme heat stalls production. Tomatoes stop setting fruit above 95°F. This isn't as severe as Texas's dead zone, but it's real. Coastal and foggy areas skip this entirely — they're often just hitting their stride in August.

> **Pro Tip:** Your local UC Master Gardener program is the single best free resource for region-specific planting advice. Every county in NorCal has one. Google "[your county] Master Gardeners" and you'll find planting calendars, workshops, and a help desk staffed by people who garden in your actual microclimate. Use them.

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating NorCal like one climate.** Planting dates for a foggy San Francisco backyard have almost nothing in common with a Sacramento Valley plot. Trust your region, not generic "Northern California" advice.
- **Ignoring the winter growing season.** If your garden sits empty from November to March, you're wasting the easiest, most water-efficient growing months of the year.
- **Overwatering in winter, underwatering in summer.** The Mediterranean rhythm is counterintuitive if you moved here from the East Coast. Rain handles winter. You handle summer. Don't reverse them.
- **Planting tomatoes too early.** Soil temperature matters more than air temperature. A tomato planted in cold soil in March will sulk for weeks and get outpaced by one planted in warm soil in mid-April.
- **Ignoring fire season.** If you're in Wine Country or the Foothills, your garden plan needs to account for smoky air, potential evacuations, and defensible space. We'll cover this in detail.

# Chapter 2: Understanding NorCal Soil

California has over 1,000 identified soil types. In NorCal alone, you might find clay, sandy loam, decomposed granite, serpentine, ancient seabed sediment, and volcanic ash — sometimes all within the same county. Understanding your particular soil isn't just helpful. It's the difference between growing food and growing frustration.

## Soil Types Across the Regions

### Bay Area Soils

The Bay Area's geology is a collision zone — literally. The Pacific and North American plates meeting here have created an insane quilt of soil types.

**Clay soils** dominate much of the East Bay flatlands and South Bay. Heavy, slow-draining, nutrient-rich, and maddening to dig. When wet, it sticks to everything. When dry, it cracks.

**Sandy loam** appears along the coast and in some valley pockets. It drains fast, warms quickly, and needs constant feeding.

**Serpentine soil** is NorCal's special challenge. Derived from serpentinite rock, it's high in magnesium, low in calcium, and toxic to many plants due to heavy metals like nickel and chromium. Found in patches throughout the East Bay hills, Marin, and the Peninsula. If your soil has a blue-green tinge and nothing seems to grow, get it tested for serpentine.

**Adobe clay** — the thick, dark, expansive clay found in parts of the South Bay and East Bay — is legendarily difficult. It holds water like a bathtub and shrinks dramatically when dry. Raised beds are strongly recommended.

### Sacramento Valley Soils

You're gardening on some of the finest agricultural soil in the world. The Sacramento Valley floor is built from millennia of river deposits — deep, fertile alluvial soil that farmers pay premium prices for.

**Silt loam and clay loam** are the dominant types. Rich in nutrients, with good water-holding capacity. pH is typically 6.5–7.5, close to ideal for most vegetables.

**Hardpan** is the hidden enemy. Many valley locations have a dense, cemented layer (called "hardpan" or "duripan") 2–4 feet below the surface. It blocks drainage and can create waterlogged conditions in winter. You won't hit it with a shovel in most cases, but if your garden puddles for days after rain, hardpan may be the culprit.

**Vernal pool soils** — if you're on the eastern edge of the valley near the foothills, you may encounter heavy clay associated with seasonal wetlands. Extremely slow drainage.

### Wine Country Soils

Wine Country is famous for soil diversity, and for good reason. Within a single Napa vineyard, you might find three different soil types.

**Valley floor:** Deep, fertile alluvial soil similar to the Sacramento Valley. Excellent for gardening with minimal amendment.

**Benchland and hillsides:** Volcanic soils (especially in Napa), rocky loam, and decomposed sandstone. Often well-drained but shallow. These soils can be fantastic for vegetables — the drainage and mineral content that make great wine grapes also make great tomatoes.

**Western slopes (Sonoma Coast influence):** Heavier clay, more acidic, cooler. Garden more like coastal Bay Area than inland Wine Country.

### Sierra Foothills Soils

Foothills soil is almost universally challenging.

**Decomposed granite** is the signature soil type — rocky, fast-draining, low in nutrients, and acidic (pH 5.5–6.5). It's essentially crumbled rock with minimal organic matter. The good news: drainage is never a problem. The bad news: water and nutrients pass through like sand in an hourglass.

**Red clay** appears at lower elevations and in certain geological bands. Heavy, iron-rich, slow-draining — the opposite problem from decomposed granite.

**Shallow soil over bedrock** is common on slopes. You might have 8 inches of soil sitting on solid rock. Raised beds aren't just convenient here — they're often the only option.

## Soil Testing: The $20 Decision That Saves You $200

Test before you amend. Every time.

**Where to test:**

- **UC Davis Analytical Lab** — The gold standard for California gardeners. About $20–30 for a basic garden soil test. They'll analyze pH, nutrients, organic matter, and salinity. Results come with interpretations calibrated for California conditions. Submit online at anlab.ucdavis.edu.
- **Your county's UC Cooperative Extension** office can help you interpret results and make amendment recommendations specific to your area.
- **Home test kits** give rough readings. Fine for a pH spot-check, not sufficient for comprehensive planning.

**How to sample:**

1. Take 8–10 small samples from across your garden area
2. Dig 6–8 inches deep at each spot
3. Mix all samples in a clean bucket
4. Air-dry the mix
5. Bag about 2 cups and submit

**What to look for in NorCal:**

- **pH:** Most NorCal soils range from 5.5 (foothills decomposed granite) to 7.8 (valley clay). Vegetables want 6.0–7.0. Adjust with lime (if too acid) or sulfur (if too alkaline).
- **Organic matter:** NorCal soils are often below 2%, especially in the valley and foothills. You want 4–5%. Compost is the answer.
- **Iron and zinc:** Alkaline soils can lock out iron, causing interveinal yellowing (chlorosis). Common in valley clay soils.
- **Salinity:** If you irrigate with well water in the valley, salts can build up. This shows on your test as high EC (electrical conductivity).

> **Pro Tip:** If you're in the Sierra Foothills with decomposed granite soil, don't bother trying to fix the native ground. Build raised beds 12–18 inches deep, fill them with a quality garden mix (1/3 compost, 1/3 topsoil, 1/3 coarse material), and save yourself years of frustration. The decomposed granite underneath actually provides perfect drainage beneath your beds.

## Building Soil the NorCal Way

California's Mediterranean climate creates a soil-building challenge: the decomposition cycle is compressed. Organic matter breaks down fast in warm, dry summers, so you need to replenish it more aggressively than gardeners in cooler, wetter climates.

**Annual soil building protocol:**

1. **Fall (October):** Spread 2–3 inches of quality compost over all beds. This is your primary feeding. The winter rains will work it in gently.
2. **Plant cover crops (November):** Crimson clover, fava beans, or a mix of legumes and grasses. They protect soil from winter rain erosion, fix nitrogen, and add organic matter when turned under in spring.
3. **Spring (March):** Cut and turn under cover crops 2–3 weeks before planting. Add another inch of compost if soil still feels dense.
4. **Summer:** Mulch heavily (3–4 inches) to protect soil biology from baking in the dry heat. Bare soil in a NorCal summer gets hot enough to sterilize the top few inches.

**Cover crops deserve special mention.** In NorCal, cover cropping over winter is the single highest-impact soil building practice you can adopt. The rain does the watering, the legumes fix nitrogen, the roots break up compacted soil, and you're building organic matter during months when you might not be growing food crops. More details in Chapter 11.

## Compost Sources and Quality

Not all compost is equal, and in California, there's a specific concern: **persistent herbicide contamination.** Aminopyralid, clopyralid, and similar broadleaf herbicides survive the composting process and can devastate tomatoes, beans, and other sensitive crops for years.

**Safe sources:**

- **Municipal green waste compost** from your local waste management facility — usually safe and affordable ($30–50/cubic yard). Ask if they test for persistent herbicides.
- **Your own compost** — you know exactly what went in.
- **Reputable landscape supply companies** that can certify herbicide-free product.

**Risky sources:**

- Manure from horses or cattle that ate hay treated with aminopyralid. One contaminated bale can ruin beds for 2–3 years.
- Compost of unknown origin from Craigslist or informal sources.

**The bioassay test:** Before spreading new compost on your entire garden, fill a small pot with the compost, plant three bean or tomato seeds, and wait two weeks. If the seedlings grow normally, you're clear. If leaves curl, cup, or distort, the compost is contaminated. This $0 test can save your entire season.

## Common Mistakes

- **Adding amendments without testing.** Adding lime to already-alkaline valley soil makes things worse. Test first.
- **Working clay soil when wet.** This creates clods that take years to break down. Wait until it's moist but not sticky — it should crumble when squeezed, not form a shiny ball.
- **Ignoring decomposed granite soil.** Foothills gardeners who try to "improve" native DG soil often fight a losing battle. Build up (raised beds), don't dig down.
- **Skipping cover crops.** Free nitrogen, free organic matter, free erosion control during the rainy season. There's no good reason not to.
- **Using contaminated compost.** Always bioassay new compost sources. Always.

# Chapter 3: Microclimates — NorCal's Secret Weapon

In most parts of the country, if you know your USDA zone, you know your garden's climate. In Northern California, your zone is just the starting point. The real story is your **microclimate** — the specific combination of temperature, fog, wind, sun exposure, and elevation that makes your exact garden plot different from one a mile away.

This isn't academic. Understanding your microclimate is the difference between growing flavorless supermarket tomatoes and growing the kind that make your neighbors knock on your door in August.

## What Creates NorCal Microclimates

### Marine Influence and the Fog Belt

The Pacific Ocean is 55°F year-round off the NorCal coast. When hot inland air rises, it pulls that cold ocean air through gaps in the Coast Range — the Golden Gate, the Petaluma Gap, the Carquinez Strait, the Salinas Valley gap. This creates fog and cool winds that can drop temperatures 20–30°F within just a few miles.

**Fog belt gardening** (San Francisco, coastal Marin, Pacifica, Half Moon Bay, parts of Berkeley and Richmond):

- Summer highs often 60–68°F
- Cool-season crops thrive year-round
- Warm-season crops need heat-trapping strategies: south-facing walls, raised beds (warmer than ground level), dark mulch, row covers, and heat-loving variety selection
- You will never reliably grow melons or long-season peppers outdoors. Accept this.

**Transitional zones** (Oakland hills, inner Marin, eastern San Mateo, Santa Rosa):

- Fog burns off by midday most summer days
- Warm enough for tomatoes and peppers with variety selection
- The best of both worlds — moderate heat without the extremes of the inland valleys

**Inland valleys** (Walnut Creek, Livermore, Concord, eastern Napa, Sacramento):

- Little to no marine influence
- Hot summers, cold (for California) winters
- Grow anything that needs heat
- Summer irrigation demands are highest here

### Elevation Effects

In the Foothills and Wine Country ridgetops, elevation drives climate more than distance from the coast.

**Rule of thumb:** For every 1,000 feet of elevation gain, expect:

- Average temperatures 3–5°F cooler
- Growing season 2–3 weeks shorter
- Frost risk extends later in spring and arrives earlier in fall
- More precipitation (especially above 2,500 feet)

A garden at 1,500 feet in the Foothills has a growing season comparable to Wine Country valley floors. At 3,500 feet, you're in a mountain climate with a short, intense growing season more like the Pacific Northwest.

### Slope Aspect and Cold Air Drainage

**South-facing slopes** receive more direct sunlight and warm earlier in spring. They're prime real estate for warm-season crops in cooler areas.

**North-facing slopes** stay cooler and moister — better for cool-season crops and less irrigation-dependent, but challenging for tomatoes and peppers.

**Cold air drainage:** Cold air is heavy. It flows downhill like water and pools in low spots — valley floors, basins, and anywhere blocked by a wall, fence, or dense hedge. If your garden is at the bottom of a slope, you'll frost sooner and later than your uphill neighbors.

This is why a garden halfway up a foothill slope can be warmer than one on the valley floor below — the cold air drains past it and pools at the bottom. Wine grape growers have known this for centuries. Now you do too.

### Urban Heat Island

Cities are warmer than their surroundings. Concrete, asphalt, and buildings absorb heat during the day and release it at night. Downtown Sacramento is consistently 3–5°F warmer than surrounding agricultural areas, especially at night. This extends your frost-free season and can push your zone half a step warmer.

If you garden on a downtown rooftop or in a small backyard surrounded by buildings and pavement, you effectively have a warmer, more sheltered microclimate than the zone maps suggest.

## Mapping Your Own Microclimate

Before your first planting season, spend time observing:

1. **Sun exposure:** Track where shadows fall in your garden at different times of day and different seasons. Most vegetables need 6–8 hours of direct sun minimum. In the fog belt, maximize every ray.

2. **Wind patterns:** Prevailing winds in the Bay Area come from the west/northwest. A windbreak (fence, hedge, building) on the windward side of your garden reduces evaporation and wind stress dramatically.

3. **Cold spots:** On clear, still winter nights, walk your property after dark. The coldest spots will be obvious — low areas, places away from buildings, north-facing exposures. Don't plant frost-sensitive crops there.

4. **Thermal mass:** South-facing brick walls, concrete patios, and stone borders absorb heat and radiate it back at night. Planting tomatoes against a south-facing wall can gain you 2–3 weeks on both ends of the season.

5. **Get a min/max thermometer.** Put it in your garden (not on a north-facing wall or in full sun — you want representative conditions). Record highs and lows for a few months. You'll be surprised how different your garden is from the nearest weather station.

> **Pro Tip:** In the fog belt, a cheap soil thermometer is your best planting guide. Forget air temperature — check your soil temp at 4 inches deep. Tomatoes want soil at 60°F minimum before transplanting. Soil in foggy areas can stay below 60° well into May or even June.

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming your friend's garden works like yours.** In NorCal, two gardens five miles apart can have completely different growing conditions. Observe YOUR garden.
- **Fighting your microclimate.** If you're in the fog belt, don't spend years failing at watermelons. Grow incredible lettuce, peas, and brassicas instead — then trade with your inland friends for their tomatoes.
- **Ignoring wind.** Coastal and ridge-top wind doesn't just chill plants; it desiccates them. A simple windbreak — even a temporary fabric one — can transform a marginal growing space.
- **Overlooking cold air pooling.** The lowest spot in your yard is almost always the coldest. Plant frost-sensitive crops on higher ground or slopes.

# Chapter 4: Fire-Safe Gardening and Drought-Smart Water

If there are two things that define NorCal gardening in the 21st century, they're fire and water. They're connected — the same dry conditions that make drought a constant concern also make wildfire season increasingly dangerous. This chapter tackles both.

## Fire-Safe Gardening

If you live in Wine Country, the Sierra Foothills, or the East Bay hills — anywhere in a **Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)** zone — your garden plan needs to account for fire.

This isn't about panic. It's about smart design. A well-planned vegetable garden can actually *improve* your property's defensible space.

### Defensible Space Zones and Your Garden

California law (PRC 4291) requires 100 feet of defensible space around structures in fire-prone areas. Your vegetable garden fits into this framework:

**Zone 0 (0–5 feet from structures):** The "ember-resistant zone." No combustible material. Not the place for garden beds with dry mulch piled against your house.

**Zone 1 (5–30 feet):** Lean, clean, and green. This is where your vegetable garden is actually an asset. Irrigated, maintained raised beds with green growing plants are *less* fire-prone than dry ornamental landscaping. A well-watered vegetable garden creates a firebreak, not a fire risk.

**Zone 2 (30–100 feet):** Reduced fuel. Space plants, remove dead material, maintain irrigated islands rather than continuous vegetation.

### Fire-Smart Garden Design

- **Keep beds irrigated.** A watered garden is a fire-resistant garden. This is one case where your irrigation habit is doing double duty.
- **Avoid dry mulch within 5 feet of structures.** Use gravel, decomposed granite, or stone mulch near the house. Save the wood chip mulch for beds further out.
- **Clear dead plant material promptly.** Don't let spent tomato vines and dried bean plants accumulate. Compost them or remove them.
- **Metal or stone raised beds** are preferable to wood in Zone 1. If using wood, keep beds watered and don't let mulch pile against the wooden sides.
- **Maintain paths and access.** Wide, clear paths between beds reduce continuous fuel and give firefighters access if needed.
- **Store combustibles away from the garden.** Stacked dry stakes, trellises, and bamboo poles should be in a non-combustible storage area, not leaning against the house.

### Smoke and Air Quality

Extended wildfire smoke — now a regular feature of NorCal summers and falls — affects your garden in several ways:

- **Reduced sunlight.** Heavy smoke can cut photosynthesis significantly, slowing growth and reducing yields.
- **Ash deposition.** Wildfire ash is generally alkaline and may contain trace contaminants. Wash produce thoroughly. If ash accumulation is heavy, consider removing the top layer from beds.
- **Your health.** Don't garden when AQI exceeds 150. Wear an N95 if you must work outside at lower AQI levels. No harvest is worth your lungs.
- **Plants are resilient.** A week or two of smoky conditions won't kill established plants. They'll bounce back when skies clear.

### Evacuation-Ready Garden Planning

If you live in an evacuation zone:

- Keep your garden infrastructure simple enough that losing it won't be devastating. Don't build a $5,000 irrigation system if you might need to abandon it.
- Store irreplaceable seeds and garden records in your go-bag or digitally.
- Build relationships with neighbors — they can water for you during short evacuations.
- Accept that some fire seasons, your garden will take a back seat. That's okay. Gardens come back. Lives don't.

## Drought-Smart Watering

Northern California is in a permanent conversation about water. Whether we're in an official drought or a wet year, efficient irrigation is non-negotiable for responsible NorCal gardening.

### How Much Water Do Vegetables Actually Need?

Most vegetables need **1–1.5 inches of water per week** during the growing season. In the Sacramento Valley at peak summer, that climbs to **2 inches per week** due to high evapotranspiration (ET).

In real numbers: 1 inch of water over a 4×8 raised bed = about 20 gallons. So a typical bed needs 20–40 gallons per week in summer.

For context, a 10-minute run of a standard garden hose delivers about 50 gallons. You're not talking about vast quantities — you're talking about *precise delivery*.

### Drip Irrigation: The NorCal Standard

Overhead sprinklers waste 30–50% of water to evaporation and overspray. In NorCal's dry summers, that's unacceptable.

**Drip irrigation** delivers water directly to the root zone with 90%+ efficiency. It should be your default system.

**A basic drip setup for raised beds:**

1. **Timer** at the hose bib — a simple battery-operated timer ($25–40) automates everything. Water at dawn for best efficiency.
2. **Pressure regulator** (25 psi) — drip systems run at low pressure. Without a regulator, you'll blow emitters.
3. **Filter** — screens out particles that clog emitters.
4. **½-inch mainline tubing** — runs from the timer to your beds.
5. **¼-inch drip line or soaker tape** within beds, spaced 12 inches apart for most vegetables.

Total cost for a 4-bed garden: $60–100. This is the single best investment you'll make.

**Watering schedule guidelines:**

| Season | Sacramento Valley | Inland Bay Area | Coastal Bay Area | Foothills |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Spring (Mar–May) | 2–3x/week | 2x/week | 1–2x/week | 2x/week |
| Summer (Jun–Aug) | Daily | 4–5x/week | 2–3x/week | 4–5x/week |
| Fall (Sep–Nov) | 2–3x/week | 1–2x/week | 1x/week | 2x/week |
| Winter (Dec–Feb) | Rainfall only* | Rainfall only* | Rainfall only* | Rainfall only* |

*Supplement only during dry spells of 10+ days without rain.

### Mulch: Your Water-Saving Multiplier

Mulch reduces soil evaporation by 50–70%. In NorCal's dry summers, this is the difference between watering daily and watering every other day.

**Best mulch options for vegetable gardens:**

- **Straw** (not hay — hay has weed seeds): 3–4 inches around plants. Affordable, decomposes slowly in dry summers, won't mat down. The classic choice.
- **Wood chips** (arborist chips): 3–4 inches on pathways and around permanent plantings. Free from tree services (check chipdrop.com). Don't work directly into soil — use on the surface.
- **Shredded leaves:** Free if you have deciduous trees. Excellent around beds. Decomposes faster than straw.

**Avoid:** Rubber mulch, dyed wood, and anything non-organic in food gardens.

### Greywater and Rainwater: Free Water

**Rainwater harvesting** makes enormous sense in NorCal. All your rain falls in a 5-month window, and all your irrigation demand is in the other 7 months. Capturing winter rain for summer use closes that gap.

- A 1,000-square-foot roof generates about 600 gallons per inch of rain.
- In an average NorCal winter (20–30 inches total), that same roof could capture 12,000–18,000 gallons.
- A 275-gallon IBC tote ($50–100 used) is the most cost-effective storage option. Stack several for serious capacity.

California law explicitly allows rainwater harvesting with no permit required for residential use.

**Greywater** — water from sinks, showers, and washing machines (not toilets or kitchen sinks with garbage disposals) — is legal for subsurface irrigation in California under a simple permit. A laundry-to-landscape system can deliver 15–25 gallons per load directly to fruit trees or large garden beds.

> **Pro Tip:** Install a **soil moisture meter** ($10–15) and check it before watering. The #1 cause of water waste in home gardens is watering on a schedule instead of watering based on need. Stick the probe 4–6 inches deep in your bed. If it reads "moist," skip the watering. Simple.

### Ollas: Ancient Tech That Works

**Ollas** (pronounced "oy-yahs") are unglazed clay pots buried in garden beds and filled with water. The water seeps through the porous clay directly into surrounding soil, drawn out by root suction. They're 70% more efficient than surface drip and have been used in arid climates for 4,000+ years.

You can buy ollas commercially ($20–40 each) or make DIY versions from two terracotta pots glued rim-to-rim with the drain hole at top for filling. One olla irrigates roughly a 2-foot radius. They're perfect for NorCal raised beds and container gardens.

## Common Mistakes

- **Overhead watering in summer.** You're losing half your water to evaporation and encouraging foliar disease. Switch to drip.
- **Watering on a rigid schedule.** Water when the soil needs it, not when the calendar says so. Check soil moisture.
- **Skipping mulch.** Bare soil in a NorCal summer is a water-wasting tragedy. Mulch everything.
- **Ignoring fire-safe practices in WUI zones.** Your garden can be an asset or a liability during fire season. Make it an asset.
- **Gardening during hazardous air quality events.** Your tomatoes can wait. Your lungs can't.

# Chapter 5: Planning Your NorCal Garden

Good planning in NorCal is different from most of the country because you're planning for a year-round garden with two to three distinct seasons, not a single spring-to-fall run. Get your plan right and you'll harvest something every month. Get it wrong and you'll have gluts and gaps — drowning in zucchini in July and buying lettuce from the store in February.

## Choosing a Garden Style

### Raised Beds

The default choice for most NorCal gardeners, and for good reason:

- **Essential** in the Foothills (shallow/rocky soil), on Bay Area clay, and anywhere with drainage issues
- Warm up faster in spring (big advantage in cooler areas)
- Better drainage in winter rains
- Defined paths keep you off the soil
- Easier to protect with row covers, bird netting, deer fencing

**Recommended dimensions:** 4 feet wide (reachable from both sides), 8–12 feet long, 12–18 inches deep. If you're on hardpan, rock, or contaminated soil, go 18 inches minimum.

**Materials:** Untreated redwood or cedar (NorCal native — naturally rot-resistant, lasts 10–15 years). Corrugated metal (galvanized steel or Corten). Concrete blocks. Avoid pressure-treated wood in food gardens.

### In-Ground Beds

If you have deep, well-drained soil (lucky Sacramento Valley gardeners, some Wine Country valley floors), in-ground beds are perfectly viable and cheaper to establish. Amend the top 12 inches with compost and go.

### Container Gardening

For Bay Area renters, deck gardeners, and anyone with limited space:

- Use the **largest containers you can manage.** Minimum 5 gallons for tomatoes and peppers. 15–20 gallon fabric pots are ideal.
- **Fabric grow bags** (Smart Pots, Root Pouch) are affordable, drain well, and air-prune roots for healthier plants.
- Containers dry out fast in NorCal summers. Daily watering is common. Drip on a timer is a game-changer for container gardens.
- In the fog belt, dark-colored containers absorb more heat — an advantage for warm-season crops.

## Succession Planting: The Key to Year-Round Harvest

**Succession planting** means staggering your plantings so you harvest continuously instead of all at once.

**Example: Lettuce**
- Sow 6–10 plants every 3 weeks from September through April (in the Bay Area, this is nearly 8 months of continuous lettuce)
- As one batch is harvested, the next is ready
- Total plants at any time: 12–20, but you never have 50 heads of lettuce going bad simultaneously

**Example: Beans**
- Plant a first round in April, second in June, third in late July (Sacramento Valley timing)
- Each planting produces for 4–6 weeks before declining
- Continuous beans from June through October

Build succession into your plan from the start. Use a simple spreadsheet or notebook with planting dates every 2–3 weeks for quick-maturing crops.

## Crop Rotation in Small Spaces

Even in a 4-bed garden, rotate plant families between beds each season:

| Family | Examples | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Solanaceae | Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant | Heavy feeders. Don't follow with same family for 2 years. |
| Cucurbits | Squash, cucumbers, melons | Heavy feeders. Susceptible to soil-borne diseases. |
| Brassicas | Broccoli, kale, cabbage, cauliflower | Moderate feeders. Clubroot persists in soil. |
| Legumes | Beans, peas, fava beans | Fix nitrogen. Plant BEFORE heavy feeders. |
| Alliums | Onions, garlic, leeks | Light feeders. Break pest cycles. |
| Root crops | Carrots, beets, radishes | Light feeders. Good rotation gap-fillers. |

**The simple 4-bed rotation:** Bed 1 gets legumes (building nitrogen) → Bed 1 gets solanaceae next season (using that nitrogen) → Bed 1 gets brassicas → Bed 1 gets root crops/alliums → repeat.

## What to Grow: The NorCal Top 10 for Beginners

If this is your first NorCal garden, start here:

1. **Tomatoes** — The king. Grow 'Early Girl' in the fog belt, anything you want inland.
2. **Lettuce and salad greens** — Nearly year-round in most of NorCal. Stupidly easy.
3. **Zucchini** — One plant feeds a family (and their neighbors, and the neighbors' neighbors).
4. **Beans** (bush type) — Fast, productive, improve soil.
5. **Garlic** — Plant in October, harvest in June. Zero maintenance over winter.
6. **Kale** — Grows 9+ months of the year. Frost improves the flavor.
7. **Peppers** — Inland areas only for best results. Not worth the effort in the fog belt.
8. **Cucumbers** — Quick, prolific, kids love them.
9. **Herbs** (basil, cilantro, parsley) — Fresh herbs are the fastest way to improve your cooking.
10. **Fava beans** — Plant in fall, harvest in spring. A NorCal tradition and incredible soil builder.

## Seed Sourcing: NorCal Edition

Buy from companies that trial varieties in California conditions:

- **Renee's Garden Seeds** (Felton, CA) — Curated, well-tested varieties. Excellent for NorCal.
- **Botanical Interests** — Beautiful packets, good variety selection.
- **Peaceful Valley Farm Supply / Grow Organic** (Grass Valley, CA) — Outstanding for NorCal. Carries cover crop seed, organic amendments, everything.
- **Kitazawa Seed Company** (Oakland, CA) — Specializes in Asian vegetable varieties that thrive in NorCal's climate.
- **Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds** — Massive selection of heirlooms.
- **Territorial Seed Company** (Oregon) — Excellent for Pacific Coast conditions.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planning only for spring/summer.** Your plan should include fall and winter plantings. Map out all 12 months.
- **Planting too much of one crop at once.** Three zucchini plants will produce more than any family can eat. One is usually enough.
- **Not planning for succession.** Plant a little every 2–3 weeks, not everything at once.
- **Buying seeds from random sources.** A variety bred for Virginia won't necessarily perform in NorCal. Buy from West Coast or California-specific suppliers.
- **Skipping garlic.** It goes in the ground in October when nothing else is happening. Free, easy food six months later.

# Part II: Month-by-Month Growing Guide

# Chapter 6: January — The Quiet Start

January in NorCal is gray, wet, and deceptively productive. While the rest of the country is locked in winter, your garden should already have things growing — garlic you planted in October, overwintering fava beans, maybe some late-season kale that's sweetened beautifully after a few light frosts.

This is also your planning month. Seed catalogs are arriving. New varieties are calling. Resist the urge to order everything, but do order now — popular varieties sell out by February.

## What to Do This Month

**All regions:**

- **Order seeds.** Prioritize tomato, pepper, and eggplant varieties — these get started indoors first.
- **Maintain winter crops.** Harvest kale, chard, lettuce, and other overwintering greens. Pick outer leaves to keep plants producing.
- **Feed garlic.** Side-dress with a balanced organic fertilizer or compost if growth seems slow.
- **Plan crop rotation.** Sketch your bed layout for the coming year.
- **Maintain tools.** Sharpen pruners, clean and oil hand tools, check irrigation systems for winter damage.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- You can direct-sow peas, lettuce, arugula, radishes, and spinach right now. The mild maritime winter barely slows cool-season crops.
- Start thinking about potato planting in February.

**Bay Area (inland) / Wine Country / Sacramento Valley:**

- Tule fog and cold nights slow growth but rarely kill hardy cool-season crops.
- Start tomato and pepper seeds indoors under lights late this month or early February if you want transplants ready by April.
- Prune dormant fruit trees (not a veggie task, but while you're out there...).

**Sierra Foothills:**

- This is genuine winter. Frost and possible snow above 2,500 feet.
- Focus on planning, seed ordering, and tool maintenance.
- Cover crops should be growing; leave them alone until spring.
- Start seeds indoors under grow lights if you want a jump on the season.

## Starting Seeds Indoors

January/February is when NorCal gardeners start their long-season warm crops indoors. Tomatoes and peppers need 6–8 weeks from seed to transplant-ready size.

**Basic indoor seed starting setup:**

- **Seed starting mix** (not garden soil) — sterile, light, fast-draining
- **Cell trays or small pots** (2–3 inch)
- **Grow light** — A basic 2-foot or 4-foot LED shop light hung 2–3 inches above seedlings, 14–16 hours/day. Windowsills alone don't provide enough light in NorCal's cloudy January/February.
- **Heat mat** (optional but valuable for peppers) — keeps soil at 75–85°F for fast germination
- **Timing:** Tomatoes start indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant date. Peppers start 8–10 weeks before transplant.

**Transplant timing targets:**

| Crop | Indoor Start | Transplant Out |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Tomatoes | Late Jan–mid Feb | April 1–May 1* |
| Peppers | Mid Jan–early Feb | April 15–May 15* |
| Eggplant | Late Jan–mid Feb | April 15–May 15* |

*Sacramento Valley and inland Bay Area on the early end. Foothills and Wine Country on the late end. Fog belt: wait for soil temps above 60°F.

> **Pro Tip:** Don't start tomatoes too early. A leggy, root-bound transplant that's been sitting indoors for 10 weeks will get outpaced by a stocky 6-week-old transplant set out at the right time. Bigger isn't better — timing is.

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting warm-season seeds too early.** They sit indoors too long, get leggy, and struggle at transplant. Count backwards from your target transplant date.
- **Forgetting to order seeds.** Popular heirloom tomato varieties (Brandywine, Cherokee Purple, Sungold) sell out. Order in January.
- **Neglecting winter crops.** Your kale and chard are still producing. Harvest and eat them.
- **Not checking irrigation.** Winter freezes (especially Foothills) can crack drip lines and fittings. Inspect your system before spring.

# Chapter 7: February — Waking Up

February is when NorCal gardening shifts from planning to action. The days are getting noticeably longer, the earliest fruit trees are blooming, and soil temperatures start climbing. In the Sacramento Valley and lower Bay Area, this is early spring. In the Foothills, it's still firmly winter — but hope is building.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Direct sow outdoors:** peas, lettuce, spinach, radishes, carrots, beets, chard, arugula, cilantro, dill, potatoes (plant by Valentine's Day is the Sacramento tradition).
- **Transplant outdoors (late month):** broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale starts.
- **Continue indoor seeds:** tomatoes and peppers should be growing under lights.
- **Prepare beds:** Pull winter weeds, add compost to beds that didn't get a fall amendment. Turn under cover crops.

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Same as Sacramento Valley but 1–2 weeks later for frost-sensitive items.
- Direct sow cool-season crops now.
- Potatoes go in mid- to late February.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- You've been able to sow cool-season crops for months — continue.
- The big question: when to start warm-season crops? Not yet. Soil is still too cold. Be patient.
- Peas should be going strong. Start training them on trellises.

**Wine Country:**

- Valley floors: follow Sacramento Valley timing, delayed by about a week.
- Upper elevations: follow Foothills timing below.
- Turn under cover crops on valley floor beds.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Below 2,000 feet: start direct sowing peas and cold-hardy greens late in the month if the ground isn't frozen.
- Above 2,000 feet: still planning season. Keep starting seeds indoors.
- Don't rush. Late frosts are common through April.

## Potatoes: A NorCal February Tradition

Potatoes are one of the most rewarding crops for NorCal gardeners, and February is planting time for everyone except the Foothills.

**How to plant:**

1. Buy **certified seed potatoes** (not grocery store potatoes, which may carry disease and are often treated to prevent sprouting).
2. Cut large seed potatoes into 2-inch pieces, each with 2–3 eyes. Let pieces dry 24–48 hours to callus.
3. Plant 4 inches deep, 12 inches apart, in loose, compost-rich soil.
4. As plants grow, **hill up** soil or straw around the stems, leaving just the top few inches of foliage exposed. This encourages more tuber formation.
5. Harvest "new potatoes" when plants flower (about 10 weeks). Harvest full-size potatoes when tops die back (14–18 weeks).

**Best varieties for NorCal:**

- **Yukon Gold** — buttery, versatile, reliable everywhere
- **Red LaSoda** — heat-tolerant, great for Sacramento Valley
- **French Fingerling** — fantastic flavor, good keeper
- **All Blue / Purple Majesty** — fun, nutritious, great for markets

> **Pro Tip:** Potatoes need consistent moisture but hate waterlogged soil. NorCal's February rains usually provide enough water at planting time. Switch to supplemental irrigation as rains taper in spring.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting potatoes too late.** They need to mature before summer heat. February is ideal; April is too late for the valley.
- **Rushing warm-season transplants outside.** Even if air temps hit 75°F in a February warm spell, soil is still cold. A cold snap will set back or kill tender transplants.
- **Forgetting to harden off transplants.** Seedlings grown indoors need 7–10 days of gradually increasing outdoor exposure before planting out. Don't skip this step.
- **Ignoring cover crops.** If you planted a cover crop in fall, chop and turn it under 2–3 weeks before you want to plant that bed. It needs time to decompose or it'll tie up nitrogen.

# Chapter 8: March — Spring Planting Surge

March is the NorCal gardener's Super Bowl. The starting gun fires for warm-season planting in the valley and lower elevations, cool-season crops are hitting peak production, and the garden transforms from quiet to electric seemingly overnight.

Daylight is increasing rapidly. Soil temperatures are climbing. It's time to move.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Transplant outdoors:** tomatoes (late March, when soil hits 60°F), broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, lettuce, chard, herbs.
- **Direct sow:** beans (after last frost), corn (late month, soil 60°F+), squash, cucumbers (very late month in warm spots), carrots, beets, radishes, more lettuce, basil (late month).
- **Succession plant** lettuce and radishes every 2–3 weeks.
- **Start squash and cucumber seeds indoors** for transplanting in April if you didn't direct sow.

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Follow Sacramento Valley timing, especially Walnut Creek, Livermore, and Concord.
- Tomatoes can go out late March in sheltered, warm spots. Early April is safer.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- Cool-season crops are in full glory. Harvest and replant.
- Don't plant tomatoes and peppers yet. Soil is still too cold. Seriously.
- Peas, favas, lettuce, brassicas — keep these going.
- Start hardening off tomato transplants on warm days but keep them in pots. They go out in May.

**Wine Country:**

- Valley floors: tomatoes and peppers go out late March to mid-April depending on your microclimate.
- Start watching for deer. Now that things are growing, they're interested.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Below 2,000 feet: start transplanting cool-season crops. Begin hardening off tomato starts.
- Above 2,000 feet: direct sow peas, greens, root vegetables. Still too early for warm-season anything.
- Watch for late frosts. Have row covers ready.

## The Tomato Transplant Decision

This is the big one. Planting tomatoes too early is the #1 spring mistake in NorCal. Here's how to get it right:

**When to transplant tomatoes:**

✅ Soil temperature at 4-inch depth is **60°F or above** (check with a soil thermometer)  
✅ Nighttime air temperatures are consistently **above 50°F**  
✅ Last frost date has passed (or you have row covers ready)  
✅ Plants are hardened off (7–10 days of outdoor exposure)

❌ Do NOT transplant because the weather forecast shows a warm week. Check the soil, not the sky.

**Typical tomato transplant windows:**

| Region | Earliest Safe Date | Ideal Window |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Sacramento Valley | March 15–20 | March 25–April 15 |
| Bay Area (inland) | March 25–April 1 | April 1–20 |
| Wine Country (valley) | March 20–April 1 | April 1–15 |
| Bay Area (coastal) | May 1 (really!) | May 1–June 1 |
| Sierra Foothills (low) | April 15 | April 15–May 1 |
| Sierra Foothills (high) | May 1–15 | May 15–June 1 |

## Feeding the Spring Garden

As the garden wakes up, plants are hungry. Here's your spring feeding plan:

- **Transplants:** Mix a handful of worm castings and a tablespoon of balanced organic fertilizer (like Dr. Earth or E.B. Stone) into each planting hole.
- **Established cool-season crops:** Side-dress with compost or a mild organic fertilizer.
- **Garlic:** Hit it with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer now for bulb sizing. Stop fertilizing in April/May as it nears harvest.
- **Don't over-fertilize tomatoes at planting.** Too much nitrogen produces beautiful foliage and no fruit. A balanced or slightly phosphorus-heavy fertilizer at planting is ideal.

> **Pro Tip:** In NorCal, March is often when the last good rains fall before the dry season begins. Take advantage: this is the perfect time to plant anything that benefits from establishment moisture — the rain does your watering for free during the critical root-building phase.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting tomatoes too early.** (I know I keep saying this. Because people keep doing it.)
- **Letting cool-season crops bolt.** As temps rise, lettuce, cilantro, and arugula will bolt (go to seed). Harvest aggressively or pull and replant.
- **Forgetting to transition irrigation.** As rains end, you need to start supplemental watering. Don't wait until plants wilt.
- **Not protecting against late frost in the Foothills.** A killing frost in late March is completely normal above 2,000 feet. Keep row covers handy.

# Chapter 9: April — The Garden Accelerates

April is when NorCal gardens go from promising to productive. Warm-season crops are going in across the lower elevations, cool-season crops are reaching peak harvest, and you can feel the energy shift as days grow longer and warmer.

This is also when the rains start to taper. April showers are no guarantee in NorCal — you may need to start irrigating this month.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Transplant:** peppers, eggplant, basil (once nights stay above 55°F). More tomatoes for succession.
- **Direct sow:** squash, cucumbers, melons, beans, corn, sunflowers.
- **Succession plant:** lettuce (switch to heat-tolerant varieties like Jericho or Nevada), beans, radishes.
- **Start harvesting:** peas, lettuce, radishes, broccoli, favas, early potatoes.
- **Set up irrigation** if not already running. Rains may be ending for the season.

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Tomatoes should be in the ground by mid-April at latest.
- Peppers and eggplant go out late April.
- Start squash and cucumbers outdoors.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- Continue harvesting cool-season crops.
- Harden off warm-season transplants. Some protected, warm-microclimate spots might accept tomatoes late this month if soil temps cooperate.
- Plant potatoes if you haven't yet — the coastal timing is later.

**Wine Country:**

- This is prime planting time. Everything warm-season goes in now.
- Install deer fencing around new plantings. Not optional.
- Set up or test irrigation systems.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Below 2,000 feet: plant tomatoes, peppers (in warm spots), beans, squash.
- 2,000–3,000 feet: start hardening off warm-season transplants. Last frost is approaching.
- Above 3,000 feet: continue cool-season crops. Warm-season planting waits until May.

## Dealing with the Cool-Season to Warm-Season Transition

April is the awkward in-between: cool-season crops are finishing, warm-season crops are just starting, and your garden can look half-empty if you didn't plan for it.

**The handoff strategy:**

1. As cool-season crops come out (harvested broccoli, bolted lettuce), immediately replant with warm-season transplants or seeds.
2. Keep succession-sown lettuce going using heat-tolerant varieties and partial shade (afternoon shade from taller crops like tomatoes).
3. Don't pull cool-season crops prematurely — a broccoli plant that's already producing side shoots can keep going for weeks.
4. This is a great month for beans. They germinate fast, grow fast, and fill the gap while tomatoes and peppers are still getting established.

## Setting Up Support Structures

Get your trellises, cages, and stakes in now — before plants need them.

**Tomatoes:** Install sturdy cages or stakes at transplant time. Don't wait until the plant flops over. For indeterminate tomatoes, use a minimum 5-foot cage or 6-foot stake. The cheap cone-shaped cages from the hardware store are essentially decorative — they can't support a full-grown indeterminate tomato. Use concrete reinforcing wire (5-foot tall, 10-gauge) formed into cylinders. Or go with the Florida weave string trellis system for rows.

**Cucumbers and pole beans:** Vertical trellises save space and improve air circulation. A simple A-frame trellis or string line works great.

**Squash:** Bush varieties don't need support. Vining varieties can be trellised to save space — use strong support (winter squash fruit gets heavy).

> **Pro Tip:** Install shade cloth infrastructure now, even if you don't need it yet. Shade cloth (30–50%) over heat-sensitive crops can extend your lettuce and pea season by weeks in warmer areas, and it'll be essential for the Sacramento Valley's July heat. Build a simple PVC or conduit frame over beds so you can drape cloth quickly when needed.

## Common Mistakes

- **Letting the irrigation transition sneak up on you.** NorCal's dry season can start in April. Check soil moisture and be ready to supplement.
- **Planting melons in the fog belt.** They need sustained heat. Coastal Bay Area: this is not your crop. Sorry.
- **Forgetting about succession planting.** If all your tomatoes go in on the same day, they'll all ripen in the same two-week window. Stagger by 2–3 weeks.
- **Undersizing tomato support.** Your tomato will be 6 feet tall and 4 feet wide by July. Plan for the full-grown plant, not the cute transplant.

# Chapter 10: May — Peak Spring

May is NorCal at its finest. Long days, warm (but not brutal) temperatures, and the garden exploding with growth. This is when even the fog belt warms enough for warm-season planting, and inland gardens are in full spring production.

Enjoy this month. It's the sweet spot between the cool wet season and the hot dry summer. Everything is green, nothing is stressed, and your water bill is still reasonable.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- All warm-season crops should be planted by mid-May.
- **Harvest:** lettuce (last round before heat), peas (wrapping up), fava beans, broccoli (side shoots), early beans, first strawberries.
- **Plant:** late successions of beans, corn, squash. Okra (now!). Sweet potatoes (slips go in when soil is warm).
- **Mulch everything.** The dry season is here. 3–4 inches of straw on every bed.
- Water deeply and watch for signs of heat stress as temperatures climb.

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Similar to Sacramento Valley. All warm-season crops in the ground.
- Harvest cool-season crops aggressively before they bolt.
- Begin regular irrigation schedule.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- **THIS is your tomato planting month.** Soil temps are finally hitting 60°F.
- Plant tomatoes, peppers (warm spots only), beans, squash.
- Choose fog-tolerant and cool-summer tomato varieties (see Chapter 17 profiles).
- Cool-season crops continue producing beautifully. Don't rip them out to make room — coastal NorCal can run cool and warm crops simultaneously.

**Wine Country:**

- Garden should be fully planted. Focus on maintenance, watering, and feeding.
- Deer pressure peaks. Verify fencing integrity.
- Watch for powdery mildew on squash leaves — it shows up early here.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Below 2,500 feet: everything warm-season should be in or going in now.
- Above 2,500 feet: this is your tomato transplant window. Don't wait much longer.
- Watch weather for late frost warnings. Row covers at the ready through mid-May at higher elevations.

## Thinning, Feeding, and Maintenance

May is when the garden starts demanding regular attention:

**Thinning:** Direct-sown crops (carrots, beets, radishes, lettuce) need thinning to proper spacing. Do it early. It hurts to pull seedlings, but crowded plants produce nothing useful.

**Feeding:** Warm-season crops are heavy feeders. Once tomatoes set their first flowers, begin biweekly feeding with a balanced organic fertilizer or compost tea. Peppers and eggplant get the same treatment. Beans and peas fix their own nitrogen — don't fertilize them (it reduces production).

**Pest scouting:** Walk the garden daily. Check undersides of leaves for aphids, look for tomato hornworms (they appear out of nowhere), and watch for cucumber beetles on cucurbit seedlings. Early detection = easy control.

## The Fava Bean Harvest

If you planted favas in the fall (and you should have), May is harvest time in most of NorCal. Pick pods when beans are visible through the skin but pods are still bright green.

Don't skip the **double-peel** — shell the pods, then blanch the individual beans for 30 seconds, shock in ice water, and pop the beans out of their waxy skin. What's inside is buttery, vibrant green, and nothing like the mealy grey things you get from skipping this step.

Fava plants are also a brilliant soil amendment. When harvest is done, chop the plants and turn them into the soil. Those nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots are free fertilizer for whatever goes in next — typically tomatoes or peppers, which love the nitrogen boost.

> **Pro Tip:** May is your last reliable window for planting basil in most regions. It needs warm soil and warm nights. Plant it next to your tomatoes — they're companion plants in the garden and on the plate.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting too long for warm-season planting in the Foothills.** Your season is shorter. Get transplants in as soon as conditions allow.
- **Not mulching early enough.** Mulch before the soil dries out completely. It's easier to keep moisture in than to rewet dry soil.
- **Letting fava beans go too long.** Overmature favas are starchy and tough. Pick when pods are plump but still green.
- **Under-watering new transplants.** Just-planted warm-season crops need consistent moisture to establish roots. Don't let them dry out in the first two weeks.

# Chapter 11: June — Summer Begins

June marks the transition from spring to summer in earnest. Fog rolls in more aggressively along the coast (June Gloom is real), while inland valleys start hitting triple digits. Your garden's summer personality is emerging.

The last of the spring crops are finishing. Warm-season crops are sizing up. And your irrigation system is earning its keep.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Harvest:** the first tomatoes (early varieties), beans, squash, cucumbers, peppers starting to produce.
- **Manage heat:** temperatures regularly hit 100°F+. Shade cloth (30–50%) over heat-sensitive crops. Deep, infrequent watering (1–2 inches, 2–3 times per week rather than daily light watering).
- **Pull spent spring crops:** peas, lettuce, broccoli, favas. Compost or turn under.
- **Sow:** Armenian cucumbers, yard-long beans, okra — heat-lovers that thrive where others struggle.
- Plant **basil** for continuous harvest. Pinch growing tips regularly to encourage bushiness.

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Similar to Sacramento Valley but slightly cooler.
- First tomatoes ripening in warm microclimates.
- Keep succession-planting beans.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- **June Gloom**: foggy, cool, overcast mornings through much of the month. Don't panic.
- Warm-season crops planted in May are growing slowly. This is normal for the coast.
- Cool-season crops like lettuce and peas are STILL producing. Enjoy the overlap.
- This is actually a great time for coastal gardens — mild temps, long days, no heat stress.

**Wine Country:**

- Heat is building. Same strategies as Sacramento Valley for hot valley floors.
- Western Sonoma and higher elevations remain comfortable through June.
- Monitor for tomato hornworms — they arrive in force now.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Garden should be in full growth. Last-chance planting for beans and squash.
- Evenings are still cool — a nice advantage over the scorching valley.
- Begin irrigating consistently. Summer dry season is in full effect.

## Cover Crops: Planning Your Off-Season Soil Building

It seems early to think about fall cover crops in June, but now is when you should order cover crop seed. Popular NorCal cover crops and suppliers sell out by September.

**Recommended cover crops for NorCal:**

- **Crimson clover** — nitrogen-fixing, beautiful flowers, great for bees. Sow October–November.
- **Fava beans (as cover crop)** — the heavy lifter for nitrogen fixation. Sow October.
- **Annual ryegrass** — fast biomass, excellent erosion control. Mix with clover.
- **Bell beans** — similar to favas, bred specifically as a cover crop. Robust and easy.
- **Mustard** — biofumigant properties help suppress soil-borne diseases. Turn under before flowering.

Order from Peaceful Valley Farm Supply (groworganic.com) — they carry all of these in appropriate quantities for home gardens.

## Water Management in Early Summer

June is when water bills start climbing. Here's how to optimize:

1. **Water early morning** (5–7 AM). Least evaporation, lowest wind, leaves dry before nighttime (reducing disease).
2. **Deep and infrequent > shallow and often.** A 30-minute drip session that penetrates 8–10 inches encourages deep roots. Daily 10-minute sprinkles create shallow-rooted, drought-vulnerable plants.
3. **Check soil before watering.** Stick your finger or a moisture meter 4 inches into the soil. If it's moist, skip the watering.
4. **Group plants by water needs.** Tomatoes, peppers, and squash need more than herbs and root vegetables. If possible, put them on separate drip zones.

> **Pro Tip:** In the Sacramento Valley, learn about **CIMIS** (California Irrigation Management Information System). It's a network of weather stations that calculates exact evapotranspiration (ET) rates for your area daily. Check cimis.water.ca.gov, find your nearest station, and use the ET data to calculate exactly how much to irrigate. It's the difference between guessing and knowing.

## Common Mistakes

- **Panicking about June Gloom on the coast.** Your tomatoes look pathetic compared to your inland friends' posts on Instagram. That's normal. They'll catch up. Coastal tomatoes ripen in August–October, not June.
- **Watering too lightly in the valley.** Sprinkle watering in 105°F heat evaporates before it reaches roots. Water deeply.
- **Forgetting to pinch basil.** Let it flower and it stops producing leaves. Pinch flower buds the moment you see them.
- **Not ordering cover crop seed now.** It's one of those "future you will thank present you" situations.

# Chapter 12: July — The Heat Is On

July is when NorCal splits into two worlds. Inland: brutal heat, survival mode, and strategic shade management. Coast: perfect gardening weather as fog moderates temperatures and summer crops finally start growing.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Harvest hard.** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, beans — all producing heavily now. Pick daily. Leaving overripe fruit on plants signals them to slow down.
- **Manage extreme heat.** 100–110°F days are normal. Shade cloth, deep mulch, and early-morning watering are your three weapons.
- **The dead zone.** Tomatoes stop setting fruit when nighttime temps stay above 75°F. Existing green fruit will ripen, but new fruit won't form until nights cool. This isn't failure — it's biology.
- **Plan fall garden.** Yes, now. Start broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage seeds indoors for transplanting in August/September.
- **Solarize empty beds.** Wet the soil, cover with clear plastic, and let the July sun cook it for 4–6 weeks. This kills weed seeds, pathogens, and nematodes without chemicals.

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Similar to Sacramento Valley, though slightly less extreme.
- Keep harvesting and managing heat.
- Start fall-season seedlings indoors.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- **Your best month.** Fog keeps temps moderate, long days provide ample light.
- Tomatoes are sizing up and beginning to ripen in warm spots.
- Cool-season crops can still produce — some coastal gardeners grow lettuce year-round.
- Direct sow more beans, plant out late-season squash.

**Wine Country:**

- Valley floors: full summer heat management mode.
- **Fire season awareness.** July–October is peak fire season. Keep garden irrigated, clear dead material, monitor air quality.
- Western slopes and higher elevations: still comfortable. Great growing conditions.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Hot days, but cool nights (often dropping into the 50s–60s). This is actually better for tomato production than the valley — they keep setting fruit when the valley stalls.
- **Fire preparedness.** If you haven't created defensible space, do it now. Your irrigated garden is an asset, but clear dead plant material and keep it tidy.
- Peak harvest season. Enjoy it.

## Tomato Troubleshooting in the Heat

July heat causes specific tomato problems:

**Blossom drop:** Flowers fall off without setting fruit. Cause: temperatures above 90°F during the day or above 75°F at night. Solution: wait for temps to moderate. Shade cloth can help. Some varieties handle heat better (see tomato profile, Chapter 17).

**Sunscald:** White, papery patches on fruit facing the afternoon sun. Cause: direct sun exposure on fruit, often after pruning exposes previously shaded fruit. Solution: don't prune aggressively in summer. The leaf canopy protects fruit.

**Blossom end rot (BER):** Dark, sunken patches on the bottom of fruit. Cause: calcium uptake issues, almost always triggered by inconsistent watering. Solution: mulch, water deeply and regularly, don't let the soil cycle between soaked and bone-dry.

**Cracking/splitting:** Fruit cracks after sudden heavy watering or rare summer rain after dry conditions. Solution: consistent watering. Mulch. Some varieties resist cracking better than others.

## Preserving the Harvest

July's abundance creates a new problem: what to do with it all. Start preserving now while the supply is steady.

**Quick wins:**

- **Freeze:** Roast tomatoes, cool, and freeze in bags. Frozen whole cherry tomatoes are instant pasta sauce ingredients.
- **Dry:** NorCal's dry summer air is perfect for sun-drying tomatoes, herbs, and peppers. A solar dehydrator on a Sacramento Valley patio works incredibly well.
- **Quick pickles:** Cucumbers, beans, peppers — a 15-minute refrigerator pickle extends shelf life by weeks.
- **Share:** Seriously, bring zucchini to work. Leave bags on neighbors' porches. The NorCal gardening community thrives on sharing.

> **Pro Tip:** Start your fall brassica seedlings indoors in early July — broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts. They need 6–8 weeks to reach transplant size, and you'll be planting them out in September. A lot of gardeners miss the fall season because they didn't start seeds now.

## Common Mistakes

- **Giving up on tomatoes.** The heat pause is temporary. Fruit will set again when nights cool. Keep the plants alive and watered.
- **Not starting fall seeds.** This is the single biggest reason gardeners miss the fall season.
- **Over-pruning tomatoes in heat.** Those leaves are protecting fruit from sunscald. Leave them.
- **Underwatering.** July in the Sacramento Valley evaporates water shockingly fast. If beds seem to dry within hours of watering, add more mulch and increase water volume (not frequency).

# Chapter 13: August — The Turn

August is the pivot point of the NorCal garden year. The summer garden is still producing, but the smart gardener's attention is already turning to fall. This is simultaneously harvest season and planting season — you're pulling food out of the garden with one hand and planting the next round with the other.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Continue harvesting** warm-season crops. Tomatoes are ripening fast now as nighttime temps start (slowly) cooling.
- **Start fall garden transplanting.** Broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage seedlings (started in July) go out in late August/early September.
- **Direct sow fall crops:** beans (for a fall harvest), cucumbers (fast-maturing variety), winter squash (last chance).
- **Direct sow cool-season crops (late month):** lettuce (in shade of tomato plants), peas, spinach, radishes, arugula.
- **Plant garlic cloves in pots** for fall planting. (Or just mark your calendar for October.)

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Follow Sacramento Valley timing.
- Fall planting window opens slightly earlier as inland valleys cool faster in August evenings.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- **Peak tomato season.** Late-planted coastal tomatoes are finally ripening in droves.
- Continue harvesting everything. The coast has no dead zone — this is prime time.
- Start planning winter garden: what beds will get cover crops, what beds will get winter vegetables?
- Direct sow fall peas, more lettuce, carrots for winter harvest.

**Wine Country:**

- Fire season continues. Stay vigilant.
- Harvest, preserve, and begin fall planting on valley floors.
- Higher elevations: start cool-season seeds for fall.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Tomato season is peaking. Nights are cooling, fruit is setting and ripening beautifully.
- Begin transitioning to fall. Direct sow greens, root vegetables.
- First frost comes early at higher elevations — you may only have 6–8 weeks of warm-season production left above 2,500 feet.

## The Great Tomato Push

August through early October is when NorCal tomato gardens hit their stride, especially inland. The nighttime temperatures drop below 75°F, allowing fruit set to resume after the July heat pause. Simultaneously, the fruit that set in May and June is ripening in waves.

**Maximize the August–October window:**

- Water consistently. This is when fruit quality is determined.
- Feed biweekly with a potassium-rich fertilizer (tomato-specific or 0-0-60 potash supplement) to enhance flavor and fruit quality.
- Remove suckers on indeterminate varieties to direct energy to ripening existing fruit rather than new growth.
- Late August: consider "topping" indeterminate tomatoes (cutting the main growing tip). This signals the plant to ripen existing fruit rather than continuing to grow taller and set new fruit that won't mature before season's end.

## Planting Garlic: Get Ready for October

October is garlic planting time, and now is when you need to secure your seed garlic.

**Order from:**

- **Peaceful Valley / Grow Organic** (Grass Valley, CA)
- **Filaree Garlic Farm** (Okanogan, WA) — incredible selection, ships in September
- **Your local farmers' market** — many NorCal garlic farmers sell planting stock in September/October

**Best varieties for NorCal:**

- **Softneck types** (Silverskin, Artichoke): best for mild winter areas (Bay Area, Sacramento Valley, low Wine Country). Long storage life. Great for braiding.
- **Hardneck types** (Rocambole, Porcelain, Purple Stripe): perform best where winters are cooler (Foothills, upper Wine Country). Superior flavor. Produce garlic scapes in spring (a delicious bonus crop).

> **Pro Tip:** The best garlic for NorCal often comes from NorCal. If you can find locally-grown seed garlic at a farmers' market, grab it. It's already adapted to your climate, and the flavor of locally-selected varieties is often extraordinary.

## Common Mistakes

- **Only thinking about the current season.** August requires thinking about both NOW and NEXT. Harvest the summer garden AND plant the fall garden.
- **Missing the fall brassica window.** Broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage transplants that go out in September grow into the winter's star performers. Miss the timing and they bolt in spring heat before heading.
- **Not ordering garlic early.** Good seed garlic sells out. Order in August for October planting.
- **Ignoring late-season tomato care.** The best tomatoes of the year come in September and October. Don't let plants get stressed now.

# Chapter 14: September — Fall Planting Push

September is the second spring. If you missed your fall planting window in August — or even if you didn't — September is when the fall garden takes shape in earnest. Temperatures are moderating, the first rains might arrive late in the month, and the garden's energy shifts from warm-season harvest to cool-season establishment.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Transplant out:** broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, lettuce.
- **Direct sow:** lettuce, spinach, arugula, radishes, turnips, beets, carrots, peas, cilantro, dill.
- **Continue harvesting:** tomatoes (still producing strong), peppers (peak month!), eggplant, late beans.
- **Plant cover crops** on empty beds that won't be used for winter vegetables.
- **Prepare for the irrigation transition:** as temps drop, reduce watering frequency gradually.

**Bay Area (inland):**

- Same as Sacramento Valley. Fall planting in full swing.
- September can still be warm — shade cloth may still be useful for new cool-season transplants.

**Bay Area (coastal):**

- Tomatoes are STILL ripening. October tomatoes on the coast are some of the best of the year.
- Direct sow cool-season crops for winter harvest.
- Plant cover crops on empty beds.
- Fava beans go in late September or October.

**Wine Country:**

- Fire season peaks in September–October with Diablo winds (hot, dry offshore winds). Stay alert.
- Fall planting proceeds on valley floors.
- This is harvest festival season — enjoy the farmers' markets and local food culture.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Frost is approaching at higher elevations. Protect tomatoes and peppers with row covers on cold nights to extend the harvest.
- Plant cool-season crops now for fall harvest. At higher elevations, these may only have 6–8 weeks before frost limits them.
- Plant garlic in late September/October (slightly earlier than lower elevations due to earlier cold).

## The September Salad Garden

September is the perfect time to establish a cut-and-come-again salad garden that will produce through the winter:

**The mix:**

- Lettuce (butterhead, romaine, and leaf types)
- Arugula
- Spinach
- Mâche (corn salad) — incredibly cold-hardy
- Mizuna and other Asian greens
- Endive and escarole

**Method:** Broadcast a mesclun mix densely in a bed or wide container. Cut with scissors at 4 inches tall, leaving 1 inch of growth. The bed will regrow in 2–3 weeks. One 4×4 bed of mesclun can provide salad for a household for months.

**NorCal advantage:** In the Bay Area and Sacramento Valley, these greens will produce through winter with zero protection. In the Foothills and Wine Country, a simple row cover extends the season through hard frosts.

## Extending the Warm Season

Don't give up on warm-season crops just because it's September. In NorCal, you can often push tomatoes and peppers well into October or even November.

**Row covers:** Lightweight floating row cover (Agribon AG-19 or similar) draped over hoops adds 4–6°F of frost protection. Enough to survive light frosts while fruit continues ripening.

**Water walls and hot caps:** Individual plant protectors that use water's thermal mass to moderate temperatures. Overkill for most of NorCal but useful in the Foothills.

**Harvesting green tomatoes:** When frost threatens (or you're just done), harvest all remaining tomatoes, including green ones. Mature green tomatoes will ripen on a kitchen counter in 1–3 weeks. Don't put them in the fridge — cold kills the ripening enzymes.

> **Pro Tip:** September-planted garlic cloves that sprout before winter establish stronger root systems than October-planted cloves. If you're in the Foothills, consider planting garlic in late September rather than waiting for the traditional October window.

## Common Mistakes

- **Only planting in spring.** If you take one lesson from this book: the fall garden is easier, more productive, and more water-efficient than the spring garden in NorCal. Don't skip it.
- **Pulling warm-season crops too early.** Peppers and tomatoes are still producing in September, often through October. Let them go until frost or exhaustion ends them.
- **Planting brassica transplants in full sun without shade.** September can still be hot. Shade cloth for the first two weeks helps transplants establish without heat stress.
- **Forgetting cover crops.** Every empty bed should get a cover crop. Every one.

---

# Chapter 15: October — The Shift

October is magical in NorCal. The killing heat is gone, the first rains hint at the wet season ahead, and the garden enters its most graceful phase. Tomatoes are still ripening on warm days. New cool-season crops are establishing. The air smells different — earthy, autumnal, promising.

This is garlic month.

## What to Do This Month

**All regions:**

- **Plant garlic.** (See detailed instructions below.)
- **Plant fava beans** as a crop and/or cover crop.
- **Continue fall planting:** lettuce, spinach, peas, radishes, brassicas (last call for transplants in most areas).
- **Harvest the last of warm-season crops.** Green tomatoes come inside. Peppers get a final pick.
- **Clean up summer beds.** Pull spent tomato and squash vines. Compost disease-free material. Trash anything that looked diseased.
- **Sow cover crops** on all empty beds.
- **Mulch.** Winter rain can erode bare soil. Mulch or cover crops protect it.

**Sacramento Valley:**

- First rains usually arrive mid-to-late October. When they do, you can ease off irrigation for winter plantings.
- Tule fog starts appearing in low-lying areas.

**Bay Area:**

- The last coastal tomatoes of the year — often the best. Enjoy them.
- Rain begins refreshing the garden without your hose.

**Wine Country:**

- Fire season easing but not over. Stay alert through November.
- Fall colors are spectacular — enjoy your garden as aesthetic space too.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Frost is here at higher elevations. Warm-season crops are done above 2,500 feet.
- Get garlic in the ground now.
- Winter prep: clean tools, drain and store hoses at higher elevations.

## Planting Garlic: The Full Guide

Garlic is NorCal's easiest, most satisfying crop. Plant in October, ignore through winter, harvest in June. It doesn't get better than that.

**Step by step:**

1. **Select your seed garlic.** Break heads into individual cloves. Use only the largest, healthiest cloves — small cloves produce small heads. Save the little ones for cooking.

2. **Prepare the bed.** Garlic wants loose, well-drained soil with plenty of compost. Work in 2–3 inches of compost and a balanced organic fertilizer.

3. **Plant cloves pointed end up**, 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart, in rows 12 inches apart.

4. **Mulch immediately** with 3–4 inches of straw. This suppresses weeds, moderates soil temperature, and retains moisture.

5. **Water if rains haven't started.** Once the rainy season begins, winter irrigation is rarely needed.

6. **Fertilize in February/March** with a nitrogen-rich feed when growth resumes.

7. **Stop watering 2–3 weeks before harvest** (late May/June) to cure the outer skins.

8. **Harvest when lower leaves are brown** but 5–6 green leaves remain. Cure in a warm, dry, shaded area for 2–3 weeks.

**Yield expectation:** Each clove produces one head. Plant 50 cloves, harvest 50 heads. That's roughly a year's supply for a garlic-loving household.

## Putting the Summer Garden to Bed

October cleanup sets the stage for a healthy spring:

- **Remove all spent warm-season plants.** Don't leave dead tomato vines standing — they harbor overwintering pests and diseases.
- **Compost healthy material.** Trash (don't compost) anything that showed signs of disease — blight, fusarium, powdery mildew.
- **Add 2–3 inches of compost** to all beds, even those getting cover crops.
- **Repair and store irrigation.** Drain drip lines in the Foothills to prevent freeze damage. Check emitters and replace clogged ones. Store timers indoors.
- **Clean and oil tools.** A sharp, oiled tool lasts decades. A neglected one lasts years.

> **Pro Tip:** Save seeds from your best open-pollinated tomatoes, peppers, and beans. Scoop seeds onto a paper towel, dry completely, label, and store in a cool, dark place. After a few years of saving seed from your best performers, you'll have varieties adapted to YOUR specific garden. This is how heirloom varieties were created.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting garlic cloves upside down.** Pointy end up. Flat (root) end down. Every single time.
- **Not planting garlic at all.** It's the easiest crop in this book. Zero excuses.
- **Leaving summer garden debris.** Cleanup matters. Overwintering pests hide in dead plant material.
- **Skipping fall soil building.** The compost and cover crops you add now are next spring's foundation.

# Chapter 16: November — Winter Garden Establishment

November is when the wet season returns in earnest, the last warm days fade, and NorCal's winter garden takes center stage. For many gardeners, this feels like the end of the season. For NorCal gardeners, it's the beginning of a new one.

## What to Do This Month

**Sacramento Valley:**

- **Tule fog** sets in. Thick, persistent, and cold (but not freezing). It slows growth but rarely damages plants.
- Continue harvesting cool-season crops: kale, chard, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower.
- Garlic should be sprouting through its mulch. Leave it alone.
- Cover crops are establishing. The rains are doing your watering.
- **Plant onion sets or transplants** for spring harvest. Short-day varieties for NorCal.

**Bay Area:**

- Winter garden fully established. Minimal maintenance required.
- Rain, rain, rain. Put the hose away.
- Direct sow more peas, favas, greens if you want to extend the winter harvest.
- This is a great month to build new raised beds, amend soil, and work on garden infrastructure while the growing demands are low.

**Wine Country:**

- Fire season officially over (usually). Exhale.
- Winter garden mode. Harvest greens, tend cover crops, enjoy the slower pace.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Hard frosts are happening regularly above 2,500 feet. Row covers protect greens.
- Lower elevations: still mild enough for active cool-season harvest.
- Focus on winter projects: building beds, improving paths, installing fencing.

## Onion Planting

November is onion planting time in NorCal. This is a frequently overlooked crop that's incredibly easy and rewarding.

**Key concept: day length.** Onions form bulbs in response to day length, and varieties are classified as short-day, intermediate-day, or long-day. NorCal gardeners should grow **intermediate-day varieties** (or short-day in warmer areas).

**Best varieties for NorCal:**

- **Yellow Sweet Spanish** — intermediate day, large bulbs, great keeper
- **Candy** — intermediate day, sweet, excellent fresh
- **Red Torpedo / Italian Red** — intermediate day, beautiful in salads
- **Walla Walla** — long-day but works well in NorCal for spring/early summer harvest

**Planting method:**

- Transplants or sets (small bulbs) go in November–January.
- Space 4–6 inches apart, barely covering the bulb.
- Consistent moisture through winter and spring.
- Harvest when tops fall over (typically May–June).

## Winter Garden Maintenance

The winter garden is low-effort, not no-effort:

- **Harvest regularly.** Picking outer leaves from kale, chard, and lettuce stimulates new growth.
- **Weed after rains.** Winter weeds germinate with the first rains and can overwhelm beds quickly. Pull them while small.
- **Watch for slugs and snails.** Wet conditions bring them out in force. Iron phosphate bait (Sluggo) is organic-approved and very effective.
- **Don't fertilize heavily in winter.** Growth is slow due to short days and cool temps. Light feeding is fine; heavy feeding wastes nutrients that leach away in rain.
- **Monitor drainage.** If beds puddle after rain, you have a drainage problem. Raise beds, add organic matter, or install drainage channels.

> **Pro Tip:** November is the perfect month to start a **worm bin.** Kitchen scraps that pile up during the holidays turn into incredible vermicompost by spring. A basic worm bin (Rubbermaid tote, shredded newspaper, 1 lb of red wigglers) costs under $30 to set up and produces the best soil amendment money can't buy.

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming the garden is "done" for the year.** November in NorCal is planting and harvesting season. Get out there.
- **Overwatering in winter.** Let the rain do its job. Supplemental water is almost never needed November–February.
- **Ignoring weeds.** One winter weed that goes to seed becomes 10,000 spring weeds. Pull them now.
- **Not planting onions.** They go in now, grow slowly through winter with zero effort, and produce fat bulbs in spring. Don't miss this easy crop.

# Chapter 17: December — Rest, Reflect, Plan

December is NorCal's quietest garden month. Short days, long rains, and holiday distractions conspire to keep you indoors. That's fine. The garden needs less of you now, and you've earned a rest.

But don't disappear entirely. December harvests of kale, chard, winter lettuce, and Brussels sprouts are some of the most flavorful of the year. Cold concentrates sugars. That frost-kissed kale is genuinely sweeter.

## What to Do This Month

**All regions:**

- **Harvest winter crops.** Kale, chard, Brussels sprouts, broccoli side shoots, winter lettuce, spinach, leeks.
- **Check garlic.** Sprouted and growing slowly? Good. Leave it alone.
- **Review the past year.** What worked? What failed? What will you do differently? Write it down. You WILL forget by March.
- **Order seeds for next year.** Catalogs are arriving. The cycle begins again.
- **Maintain tools.** Sharpen, oil, repair. Winter is workshop time.
- **Spread compost** on beds that need it. The rain works it in.
- **Enjoy the farmers' markets.** NorCal winter markets are incredible — citrus, persimmons, winter greens, mushrooms. Support your local growers.

**Sacramento Valley:**

- Tule fog dominates. Visibility can drop to near zero. The garden sits in a gray, still, cool cocoon.
- Growth is minimal. Don't worry about it.

**Bay Area:**

- Rainy but mild. Greens continue producing.
- Good month for garden infrastructure projects when rain pauses.

**Sierra Foothills:**

- Snow possible above 3,000 feet. Garden largely dormant at higher elevations.
- Lower Foothills: cool-season crops still producing with row cover protection.

## The Garden Journal

If you do nothing else this month, **keep a garden journal.** This is the single most valuable tool a gardener can own — more useful than any book (including this one).

Record:

- **What you planted and when** — exact dates, not "sometime in March"
- **Varieties** — specific names, not just "tomatoes"
- **What worked** — "Cherokee Purple in the raised bed against the south wall was incredible"
- **What failed** — "Roma tomatoes got blossom end rot again — need better watering consistency"
- **Weather notes** — first and last frost dates, heat waves, unusual cold, rain timing
- **Pest problems** — what appeared, when, what you did about it
- **Yield** — even rough estimates help you plan quantities next year

A cheap spiral notebook works. A spreadsheet works. A phone note works. Just write it down.

## Planning Next Year

December is when next year's garden starts taking shape:

1. **Review this year's journal.** What grows best in YOUR garden?
2. **Decide what to grow more of** (the winners) and **what to drop** (the disappointments).
3. **Try 2–3 new varieties or crops** each year. Not 20 — 2 or 3. Keep the core of proven performers and experiment at the margins.
4. **Map bed rotations** for the next two seasons.
5. **Calculate seed and supply needs** and order early.

> **Pro Tip:** December Brussels sprouts are a revelation. If you've only had frozen or poorly-cooked sprouts, try them roasted fresh from the garden after a frost. Halve them, toss with olive oil and salt, roast at 425°F until crispy-edged. This converts Brussels sprout skeptics on contact.

## Common Mistakes

- **Abandoning the garden in December.** There's food out there. Go harvest it.
- **Not journaling.** You think you'll remember what worked. You won't.
- **Impulse-ordering every seed that looks interesting.** Stick to your plan. Expand gradually.
- **Forgetting to check garlic and overwintering crops.** A quick weekly walk-through keeps everything on track.

# Part III: Vegetable Profiles

# Chapter 18: Warm-Season Vegetables

These crops need warm soil, warm air, and NorCal's long, dry summers to thrive. Plant after frost danger passes and soil temperatures reach 60°F minimum. In the Sacramento Valley, that's March/April. In the fog belt, May or June.

---

## Tomatoes

**The undisputed monarch of the NorCal vegetable garden.**

Every new NorCal gardener starts with tomatoes, and for good reason — there's no vegetable with a bigger gap between what you grow at home and what you buy at the store. A sun-warmed 'Cherokee Purple' off the vine is a fundamentally different food from a gas-ripened supermarket tomato.

**Types:**

- **Determinate:** Bush-type, grows to a set size, ripens fruit in a concentrated burst, then declines. Good for canning, small spaces, and containers. ('Roma,' 'Celebrity,' 'Bush Early Girl')
- **Indeterminate:** Vining, grows continuously, produces fruit all season until frost. Needs strong support. Most heirloom and slicing tomatoes. ('Brandywine,' 'Cherokee Purple,' 'Sungold,' 'Early Girl')

**Best varieties by region:**

| Region | Recommended Varieties | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Bay Area (fog belt) | Early Girl, Stupice, Sungold, Glacier, San Francisco Fog | Choose early-maturing varieties. 60–70 day types. |
| Bay Area (inland) | Anything! Brandywine, Cherokee Purple, Mortgage Lifter | Full heat = full variety selection. |
| Sacramento Valley | Celebrity, Better Boy, Cherokee Purple, Sun Gold, San Marzano | Heat-tolerant varieties for dead zone survival. |
| Wine Country | Brandywine, Early Girl, Black Krim, Juliet, Costoluto Genovese | Outstanding growing conditions on valley floors. |
| Sierra Foothills | Early Girl, Stupice, Glacier, Siletz, Sungold | Short season? Choose 55–70 day varieties. |

**Planting:**

- Transplant when soil is 60°F+ at 4-inch depth.
- Bury the stem deep — up to the bottom set of leaves. Tomatoes root along buried stems.
- Space 24–36 inches for determinates, 36–48 inches for indeterminates.
- Cage or stake at planting time.

**Care:**

- Water 1–2 inches/week, deep and consistent. Inconsistent watering causes blossom end rot and cracking.
- Mulch 3–4 inches around (but not touching) the stem.
- Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced or potassium-rich fertilizer once fruit sets.
- Prune suckers on indeterminate varieties for larger fruit and better airflow.

**Harvest:**

- Pick when fruit is fully colored and gives slightly to pressure.
- Sacramento Valley: main harvest July–October. Fog belt: August–November. Foothills: July–September.

**Common problems:** Blossom end rot (water consistently), hornworms (hand-pick — they're enormous, you'll find them), early blight (mulch to prevent soil splash, remove affected lower leaves), late blight (rare in NorCal's dry summers, mostly a coastal/humid issue).

> **Pro Tip:** In the fog belt, grow cherry and grape tomatoes for guaranteed success. 'Sungold,' 'Sweet 100,' and 'Juliet' will ripen where larger varieties struggle. A Sungold in San Francisco is a better eating experience than a half-ripe beefsteak.

---

## Peppers (Sweet and Hot)

Peppers love heat. Inland NorCal gives them what they need. Coastal NorCal... less so.

**Best sweet varieties:**

- **Jimmy Nardello** — a NorCal favorite. Italian frying pepper, thin-skinned, insanely sweet when roasted. Productive even in marginal heat.
- **Corno di Toro** — Italian bull horn pepper. Sweet, meaty, outstanding.
- **California Wonder** — classic bell. Needs consistent heat to size up.
- **Shishito** — Blistered shishitos are the NorCal appetizer. Produces heavily in moderate heat.
- **Gypsy** — early, productive, handles cooler conditions better than most.

**Best hot varieties:**

- **Jalapeño (TAM Jalapeño for mild)** — reliable everywhere with enough heat.
- **Serrano** — productive, thin-walled, great for salsa.
- **Anaheim/New Mexico** — roasting pepper. Needs real heat.
- **Thai chili** — compact plant, enormous production. Great for containers.
- **Habanero** — needs the Sacramento Valley or similarly hot inland spot to fully mature.

**Planting:**

- Transplant 2–3 weeks after tomato transplant date (they want warmer soil and air).
- Space 18–24 inches apart.
- Peppers are shallow-rooted — mulch is critical.

**Care:**

- Water consistently but don't overwater. Peppers prefer slightly drier conditions than tomatoes.
- Feed moderately. Too much nitrogen produces foliage at the expense of fruit.
- Peppers cross-pollinate freely. If saving seed, isolate varieties by 300+ feet or bag flowers.

**Harvest:**

- All peppers start green and ripen to their final color (red, yellow, orange, etc.) over 2–3 weeks.
- Green peppers are edible but less sweet/flavorful. For maximum flavor, let them color up.
- Hot peppers: heat increases as they ripen and as the plant experiences mild water stress.

**Region notes:**

- **Fog belt:** Grow shishitos and Jimmy Nardellos — they produce in cool conditions. Skip habaneros.
- **Sacramento Valley:** Grow anything, including superhots. The heat is your friend.
- **Foothills:** Choose early varieties (65–75 days). Longer-season peppers may not ripen before frost.

---

## Summer Squash (Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Pattypan)

If tomatoes are the king of the garden, summer squash is the court jester — productive to the point of absurdity, with a sense of humor about how much you can possibly eat.

**Varieties:**

- **Black Beauty** zucchini — the classic. Productive, reliable.
- **Costata Romanesco** — Italian heirloom zucchini with nutty flavor and beautiful ribbing. The gourmet choice.
- **Golden Zucchini** — same vigor as green, easier to spot (so you don't discover baseball-bat-sized fruit hiding under leaves).
- **Yellow Crookneck** — traditional summer squash. Buttery flavor.
- **Pattypan / Scallop** — cute, mild, great for stuffing.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow or transplant after last frost when soil is 65°F+.
- Space 36 inches apart. These plants get BIG.
- Hill planting works well: mound soil 6 inches high, plant 2–3 seeds per hill, thin to 1–2 plants.

**Care:**

- Water deeply. Squash are thirsty plants.
- Mulch heavily.
- Feed monthly with balanced fertilizer.
- **Powdery mildew** is virtually guaranteed in NorCal. It's unsightly but won't kill the plant quickly. Prolong plant life with neem oil or potassium bicarbonate spray. Plant resistant varieties when available.

**Harvest:**

- Pick at 6–8 inches for best flavor and texture. Smaller = more tender.
- Check plants DAILY. A zucchini can go from 6 inches to 18 inches in 48 hours.
- Regular picking stimulates more production.
- ONE plant produces 6–10 lbs per week at peak. Plant accordingly.

> **Pro Tip:** Squash blossoms are a delicacy. Pick male flowers (long thin stems, no fruit swelling at base) in the morning, stuff with ricotta, batter, and fry. A NorCal summer evening doesn't get better than fried squash blossoms with a glass of local wine.

## Winter Squash and Pumpkins

Winter squash is the patient gardener's reward — a long-season crop that stores for months and provides hearty fall and winter eating.

**Best varieties for NorCal:**

- **Butternut** (Waltham) — the all-rounder. 100 days, stores 3–6 months, smooth and sweet.
- **Delicata** — 100 days, edible skin, phenomenal roasted. Shorter storage (2–3 months).
- **Spaghetti Squash** — 90 days, reliable, fun for kids.
- **Kabocha (Red Kuri, Sunshine)** — Japanese-style, incredibly sweet, dense flesh.
- **Acorn** — 85 days, compact vines, good for small spaces.
- **Sugar Pie Pumpkin** — the best baking pumpkin. 100 days.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow or transplant after last frost. Soil must be 65°F+.
- Space 4–6 feet for bush types, 6–10 feet for vining types. Yes, really.
- Or trellis vining types vertically and support fruit with slings.

**Care:**

- Heavy feeders. Amend soil with compost and feed monthly.
- Water deeply, especially during fruit sizing.
- Reduce watering as fruit matures (final 2–3 weeks) to concentrate sugars and cure rinds.

**Harvest:**

- Harvest when rind is hard (can't dent with fingernail), stem is dry and woody, and skin color is fully developed.
- Cut (don't pull) from vine, leaving 2–3 inches of stem attached.
- Cure in sun for 7–10 days (or indoors in a warm spot) to harden skin.
- Store in a cool, dry place (50–55°F ideal). Butternut lasts 3–6 months; delicata 2–3 months.

**Region notes:** Sacramento Valley and inland Bay Area have plenty of heat and season for all varieties. Fog belt and Foothills: choose 85–100 day varieties and start indoors for transplant to maximize the season.

## Cucumbers

Fast, prolific, and refreshing — cucumbers are summer in vegetable form.

**Varieties:**

- **Marketmore 76** — classic slicing cucumber, disease-resistant, reliable.
- **Lemon Cucumber** — round, yellow, mild. A NorCal farmers' market staple.
- **Armenian Cucumber** — technically a melon. Loves heat, never gets bitter, thin skin. Outstanding for Sacramento Valley.
- **Suyo Long** — Asian variety, sweet, burpless, heat-tolerant.
- **National Pickling / Boston Pickling** — best for pickles.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow after last frost, soil 65°F+.
- Space 12 inches apart on a trellis (recommended) or 36 inches on the ground.
- Trellised cucumbers are straighter, cleaner, and take up less space.

**Care:**

- Consistent water is critical. Stressed cucumbers turn bitter.
- Feed biweekly once fruiting begins.
- Watch for cucumber beetles — they transmit bacterial wilt. Hand-pick or use row cover until flowering.

**Harvest:**

- Pick frequently at 6–8 inches (slicing) or 3–4 inches (pickling).
- Don't let fruit get overripe on the vine — it signals the plant to stop producing.

---

## Beans (Bush and Pole)

Beans are the beginner's confidence builder. Fast to germinate, easy to grow, heavy to harvest, and they improve your soil while they're at it (nitrogen fixation from root nodules).

**Types:**

- **Bush beans:** Compact, no trellis needed, harvest in 50–60 days. Plant successions every 3 weeks.
- **Pole beans:** Climbing, need trellis, harvest in 60–70 days but produce for 8–10 weeks from a single planting.
- **Dry beans:** Grow like green beans but leave on plant until pods are dry and papery. Shell and store.

**Best varieties:**

- **Provider** (bush) — cold-tolerant, early, reliable.
- **Blue Lake** (bush or pole) — the NorCal standard for flavor.
- **Kentucky Wonder** (pole) — classic, heavy producer.
- **Dragon Tongue** (bush) — beautiful purple-streaked pods, great flavor.
- **Scarlet Runner** (pole) — gorgeous flowers, large beans, handles cooler temps than most.
- **Cranberry / Borlotti** (bush) — outstanding shell and dry bean for NorCal.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow (beans don't transplant well). Soil must be 60°F+.
- Push seeds 1 inch deep, 4–6 inches apart (bush) or 6–8 inches (pole).
- Do NOT soak beans before planting — this old advice causes more rot than benefit.

**Care:**

- Don't fertilize with nitrogen — beans make their own. Excess nitrogen produces foliage, not beans.
- Water moderately. Beans tolerate some drought.
- Harvest every 2–3 days. Regular picking extends production dramatically.

**NorCal timing:**

- First sowing: April (after last frost).
- Second sowing: June.
- Third sowing: late July/early August (for fall harvest).
- Bay Area coastal: plant through July for extended harvest in mild autumn.

## Corn

Corn needs space and heat, but NorCal's inland valleys deliver both.

**Varieties:**

- **Honey Select** — bicolor sweet corn, excellent flavor, 79 days.
- **Golden Bantam** — open-pollinated heirloom, 78 days.
- **Stowell's Evergreen** — white sweet corn, 92 days, old-fashioned flavor.
- **Glass Gem** — ornamental/flour corn. Stunning multicolored ears. Fun project.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow when soil is 65°F+. March (Sacramento Valley) through May (Foothills).
- Plant in blocks (at least 4 rows), not single rows — corn is wind-pollinated and needs neighbors.
- Space 12 inches apart, rows 30 inches apart.

**Care:**

- Heavy nitrogen feeder. Side-dress with blood meal or fish emulsion when knee-high and again when tassels appear.
- Water consistently during tasseling and ear fill (the critical window).

**Harvest:**

- Silks turn brown, ears feel full when squeezed. Pierce a kernel — milky juice = ready. Clear juice = too early. Doughy = too late.
- Sprint to the kitchen. Corn sugar converts to starch within hours of picking. This is why homegrown corn tastes otherworldly.

**Region notes:** Best in Sacramento Valley and inland Bay Area. Marginal in fog belt (not enough heat). Possible in lower Foothills with early varieties.

---

## Eggplant

Eggplant wants heat, and NorCal inland delivers.

**Varieties:**

- **Ichiban** — Japanese type, long and slender, early (58 days), handles cooler conditions.
- **Rosa Bianca** — Italian heirloom, gorgeous lavender-white, creamy flesh. Needs full heat.
- **Black Beauty** — classic globe eggplant. 80 days. Reliable.
- **Fairy Tale** — small, striped, prolific. Excellent for containers.
- **Thai Green** — for Thai curry lovers. Compact plant, heavy producer.

**Planting:**

- Transplant 2–3 weeks after tomatoes. Eggplant wants even warmer conditions.
- Space 24 inches apart. Full sun, no shade.

**Care:**

- Similar to peppers. Consistent water, moderate feeding.
- Flea beetles love eggplant. Tiny holes in leaves = flea beetles. Row cover at planting protects transplants during the vulnerable early weeks.

**Harvest:**

- Pick when skin is glossy and fruit gives slightly to thumb pressure. Dull skin = overripe and seedy.
- Use pruning shears to cut — don't pull fruit (you'll damage the plant).

**Region notes:** Fog belt — try Ichiban or Fairy Tale in the warmest spot you have. All others — excellent in full heat.

---

## Melons (Watermelon and Cantaloupe)

Melons are the ultimate heat crop. They need long, hot days and warm nights — perfect for the Sacramento Valley, questionable everywhere else.

**Cantaloupe/muskmelon varieties:**

- **Hale's Best Jumbo** — the classic. 85 days. Perfect for the valley.
- **Minnesota Midget** — 65 days, small fruit, great for shorter seasons.
- **Charentais** — French heirloom, legendary flavor. 80 days.
- **Ambrosia** — sweet, disease-resistant, reliable.

**Watermelon varieties:**

- **Sugar Baby** — icebox type, 75 days. Manageable size.
- **Crimson Sweet** — classic, 85 days, reliable in hot areas.
- **Moon & Stars** — stunning heirloom, needs long hot season.
- **Orangeglo** — orange flesh, incredibly sweet.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow or transplant when soil is 70°F+ and nights stay above 60°F.
- In Sacramento Valley: late April/May.
- Black plastic mulch or IRT (infrared transmitting) mulch warms soil and suppresses weeds.

**Care:**

- Water heavily during vine growth, reduce as fruit sizes up and nears maturity.
- Feed with phosphorus/potassium-heavy fertilizer once fruiting begins.

**Harvest:**

- Cantaloupe: fruit "slips" easily from vine when ripe. The stem separates cleanly with gentle pressure.
- Watermelon: ground spot turns from white to yellow, tendril nearest fruit dries brown, fruit sounds hollow when thumped.

**Region notes:** Sacramento Valley: paradise for melons. Inland Bay Area: good with right varieties. Fog belt: don't bother (not enough heat units). Foothills: choose short-season varieties and use black plastic mulch. Wine Country valley floors: excellent.

---

## Okra

A heat-loving crop that thrives where others wilt. Sacramento Valley gardeners, this is your summer survivor.

**Varieties:**

- **Clemson Spineless** — the standard. Productive, 55 days.
- **Burgundy** — red pods, gorgeous in the garden and on the plate.
- **Star of David** — Israeli heirloom, fat pods, excellent flavor.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow when soil is 70°F+. Late May/June in the Sacramento Valley.
- Soak seeds overnight for faster germination.
- Space 12–18 inches apart.

**Care:**

- Minimal. Okra thrives in heat that kills everything else.
- Water regularly but don't overdo it — okra is drought-tolerant once established.

**Harvest:**

- Pick pods at 3–4 inches, every 1–2 days. Overgrown pods become woody and tough.
- Plants produce until frost. In the Sacramento Valley, that's a 5-month harvest season.

---

## Sweet Potatoes

A warm-season crop that stores beautifully and practically grows itself once established.

**Varieties:**

- **Beauregard** — the standard orange sweet potato. 90 days, reliable, excellent flavor.
- **Jewel** — similar to Beauregard, slightly longer season.
- **Murasaki** — Japanese white-fleshed variety. Drier texture, excellent roasted.
- **Okinawan** — purple flesh, beautiful, sweet.

**Planting:**

- Plant **slips** (rooted stem cuttings), not seeds or tubers. Buy from a nursery or grow your own from a grocery store sweet potato suspended in water.
- Plant after soil reaches 65°F+ and nights stay above 60°F. May in Sacramento Valley, June in cooler areas.
- Space 12 inches apart in rows 36 inches apart. Or 4 slips per 4×8 raised bed.
- They need loose, well-drained soil. Raised beds are ideal.

**Care:**

- Water regularly during establishment, then reduce. Sweet potatoes are drought-tolerant.
- Don't fertilize much — too much nitrogen produces vines, not tubers.

**Harvest:**

- 90–120 days after planting, or when vines start yellowing in fall.
- Dig carefully (tubers are fragile when fresh).
- **Cure:** essential for sweet potatoes. Keep at 80–85°F with high humidity for 10–14 days. This converts starches to sugars and heals skin nicks. After curing, store in a cool (55–60°F), dark place for up to 6 months.

**Region notes:** Best in Sacramento Valley and inland Bay Area. Marginal in fog belt (needs heat). Foothills below 2,000 feet: use black plastic mulch and choose Beauregard for its speed.

# Chapter 19: Cool-Season Vegetables

These crops thrive in NorCal's mild winters and spring/fall shoulders. Many can be grown nearly year-round in the Bay Area. They tolerate (and often improve with) light frost.

---

## Lettuce and Salad Greens

**The anchor of the NorCal year-round garden.** In most of NorCal, you can harvest lettuce 9–10 months of the year. In the fog belt, 12 months.

**Types:**

- **Loose-leaf:** fastest to harvest (40–50 days), cut-and-come-again.
- **Butterhead/Bibb:** soft, tender heads. Beautiful.
- **Romaine:** crisp, upright, handles more heat than others.
- **Crisphead/Iceberg:** needs cool temps and long season. Easier in fog belt and Foothills.

**Best varieties for NorCal:**

- **Jericho** — romaine bred for desert conditions. Heat-tolerant. Perfect for Sacramento Valley spring.
- **Nevada** — heat-tolerant green leaf.
- **Flashy Trout Back** — stunning speckled romaine.
- **Butter King** — butterhead, reliable, classic.
- **Red Sails** — red leaf, bolt-resistant.
- **Little Gem** — mini romaine, perfect for small spaces.
- **Winter Density** — outstanding cold-hardy romaine for winter growing.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow or transplant. Seeds need light to germinate — press into soil surface, don't bury.
- Start sowing September for fall/winter harvest. Continue every 2–3 weeks through April.
- In hot areas, use shade cloth and start seeds in afternoon shade.

**Care:**

- Consistent moisture. Lettuce is 95% water and shows drought stress immediately (bitter flavor, bolting).
- Light feeder. A side-dressing of compost mid-season is usually sufficient.

**Harvest:**

- Cut outer leaves (cut-and-come-again) or harvest whole heads.
- Harvest in the morning for crispest leaves.

**The bolting problem:** When temps rise above 80°F consistently, lettuce bolts (sends up a flower stalk). The leaves turn bitter. Solutions: heat-tolerant varieties, afternoon shade, succession planting so you always have young plants coming.

---

## Broccoli, Cauliflower, and Cabbage (Brassicas)

The brassica family is NorCal's fall and winter backbone — hearty, nutritious, and perfectly suited to our cool, wet season.

**Broccoli varieties:**

- **Calabrese** — Italian heirloom, excellent side shoot production after main head.
- **De Cicco** — prolific side shoots, great for continuous harvest.
- **Waltham 29** — reliable, cold-hardy.
- **Belstar** — hybrid, big heads, good disease resistance.

**Cauliflower varieties:**

- **Snowball** — classic white, 70 days.
- **Cheddar** — orange, high in beta-carotene, beautiful.
- **Romanesco** — the fractal brassica. Stunning, nutty flavor.
- **Purple of Sicily** — gorgeous purple heads.

**Cabbage varieties:**

- **Golden Acre** — compact, 65 days, great for small gardens.
- **Red Acre** — red cabbage, 75 days.
- **Savoy King** — crinkled leaves, tender, beautiful.
- **January King** — cold-hardy, semi-savoy, gorgeous purple-tinged heads.

**Planting:**

- Start seeds indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant date.
- Fall garden: start seeds July, transplant September.
- Spring garden: start seeds January, transplant March.
- Space 18–24 inches apart.

**Care:**

- Heavy feeders. Work compost and balanced organic fertilizer into the bed at planting. Side-dress monthly.
- Consistent water for even growth.
- **Caterpillar control:** Cabbage loopers and imported cabbage worms are your primary pest. Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) spray is organic-approved and highly effective. Or use row cover to exclude butterflies.

**Harvest:**

- Broccoli: cut main head when florets are tight and before yellow flowers open. Then harvest side shoots for weeks.
- Cauliflower: cut when head is full, compact, and before curds separate. Self-blanching varieties are easiest.
- Cabbage: cut when head is firm and solid.

> **Pro Tip:** After cutting the main broccoli head, leave the plant in the ground. It will produce side shoots for 6–8 more weeks — often producing more total weight in side shoots than the main head. De Cicco and Calabrese are especially prolific side-shoot producers.

---

## Kale

The hardiest, most forgiving, most productive green in NorCal. Kale shrugs off frost, handles heat better than lettuce, and produces for 9+ months without replanting.

**Varieties:**

- **Lacinato (Dinosaur/Tuscan)** — dark, strappy leaves. The best flavor of any kale. Essential.
- **Red Russian** — tender, mild, beautiful purple stems. Great raw in salads.
- **Winterbor** — curly type, extremely cold-hardy. A winter workhorse.
- **White Russian** — like Red Russian but even more cold-hardy.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow or transplant. Plant August–November for fall/winter harvest. Plant March–April for spring/summer harvest (it will eventually bolt in summer heat, but slowly).
- Space 18–24 inches apart.

**Care:**

- Moderate feeder. Compost at planting plus a mid-season side-dress.
- Water regularly. Stressed kale gets tough and bitter.
- Aphid alert: check the undersides of leaves, especially in fall/spring. A strong blast from the hose knocks them off. Ladybugs and lacewings are natural predators.

**Harvest:**

- Pick outer/lower leaves from bottom up, leaving the growing tip intact. The plant keeps producing.
- Frost improves flavor — the plant converts starch to sugar as a freeze-protection mechanism. December kale from NorCal is genuinely sweet.

---

## Peas (Snap, Snow, and Shell)

A NorCal fall/winter/spring staple that kids love to eat straight off the vine.

**Types:**

- **Snap peas** (Sugar Snap) — edible pod, sweet, crunchy. The most popular.
- **Snow peas** (Oregon Sugar Pod) — flat, edible pod. Stir-fry essential.
- **Shell peas** (Green Arrow, Lincoln) — traditional English pea. Shell and eat fresh or cook.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow. Peas fix nitrogen, so don't fertilize at planting.
- Fall planting: October–November. Spring planting: January–February.
- Inoculate seeds with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium) for best results — especially on beds that haven't grown legumes recently.
- Provide a trellis or netting for climbing types.

**Care:**

- Minimal. Peas are largely self-sufficient.
- Water moderately — they don't like wet feet.
- In the Sacramento Valley, peas produce October through May. Summer heat kills them.

**Harvest:**

- Snap peas: when pods are plump and round.
- Snow peas: when pods are flat and before peas swell visibly.
- Shell peas: when peas are round inside the pod but before they get starchy.
- Pick frequently — unpicked peas signal the plant to stop producing.

---

## Fava Beans

**The quintessential NorCal winter crop.** Favas are deeply woven into NorCal food culture — from Italian-American traditions to the Bay Area restaurant scene.

**Varieties:**

- **Windsor** — large-seeded, classic. 80 days.
- **Aguadulce** — very large beans, early, cold-hardy. Popular in NorCal.
- **Sweet Lorane** — smaller beans, incredibly productive.

**Planting:**

- Direct sow October–November for spring harvest. Can also plant in February for late spring harvest.
- Push seeds 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart.
- No fertilizer needed — favas are powerhouse nitrogen fixers.
- Inoculate with Rhizobium if it's a new bed.

**Care:**

- Almost none. The rain waters them. They fertilize themselves. They grow through winter. It's embarrassingly easy.
- Stake plants if they get tall and floppy (they can reach 4–5 feet).
- Watch for aphids on growing tips in spring. Pinch off affected tips or spray with water.

**Harvest:**

- May–June for fall-planted favas.
- Pick when beans are visible through the pod but pod is still green and firm.
- Double-peel for best results (see Chapter 10 sidebar).

**Soil building bonus:** When harvest is complete, chop the plant at ground level and leave the roots in the soil. Those nitrogen nodules release nitrogen as they decompose — free fertilizer for whatever you plant next.

---

## Carrots

Sweet, crunchy, and infinitely better homegrown than store-bought (which are typically flavorless).

**Varieties:**

- **Nantes types** (Scarlet Nantes, Yaya, Bolero) — cylindrical, sweet, tender. The best for NorCal's heavier soils.
- **Danvers** — slightly tapered, handles clay better than most.
- **Chantenay** — short, stubby, great for shallow or heavy soil.
- **Imperator** — the long grocery store type. Needs deep, loose, rock-free soil.
- **Cosmic Purple / Rainbow Mix** — colorful, fun, same care as any carrot.

**Carrot Planting:**

- Direct sow only — carrots hate transplanting.
- Sow in loose, rock-free soil. Rocks and clods cause forked roots.
- Seeds are tiny. Mix with sand for even distribution. Sow ¼ inch deep.
- Germination is SLOW (7–21 days). Keep soil moist the entire time. Covering with burlap or row cover helps.
- Thin to 2–3 inches apart when seedlings are 2 inches tall.

**NorCal timing:**

- Fall planting (August–October): best season. Carrots sweeten in cool weather.
- Spring planting (February–March): harvest before summer heat turns them woody.
- Bay Area coastal: plant nearly year-round.

**Care:**

- Keep soil consistently moist. Carrots that cycle between wet and dry crack and split.
- Don't fertilize heavily — excess nitrogen produces hairy, forked roots.
- Mulch lightly to keep soil cool and moist.

**Harvest:**

- Pull when tops of roots are ¾–1 inch in diameter at the soil surface.
- Fall-planted carrots can stay in the ground through winter and be harvested as needed. They get sweeter with cold.

> **Pro Tip:** For Sacramento Valley clay soil, grow Chantenay or Nantes types in raised beds with loose, compost-rich soil. Imperator types in clay = frustration and funny-shaped carrots.

---

## Beets

Dual-purpose crop: eat the roots AND the greens.

**Varieties:**

- **Detroit Dark Red** — classic, reliable, sweet.
- **Chioggia** — Italian heirloom with stunning pink-and-white striped interior.
- **Golden** — orange-gold, doesn't stain like red beets, mild and sweet.
- **Cylindra** — cylindrical shape, uniform slices. Great for pickling.

**Beet Planting:**

- Direct sow or transplant. Each "seed" is actually a cluster of 2–4 seeds, so thinning is always necessary.
- Soak seeds overnight to speed germination.
- Sow ½ inch deep, thin to 3–4 inches apart.
- Fall planting (August–October) and spring planting (February–March).

**Care:**

- Consistent moisture. Irregular watering causes woody, zoned roots.
- Light feeder. Compost at planting is sufficient.
- Beets tolerate light frost — great for extending the season.

**Harvest:**

- Pull when roots are 2–3 inches in diameter. Larger beets get woody.
- Don't waste the greens! Sauté beet greens like chard — they're the same family and equally delicious.

---

## Garlic

Already covered extensively in Chapter 15 (October). Quick reference:

- **Plant:** October–November
- **Harvest:** May–June
- **Types:** Softneck for mild winters (Bay Area, Valley), hardneck for cooler areas (Foothills, upper Wine Country)
- **Care:** Almost none. Plant, mulch, feed once in spring, harvest.
- **Storage:** Properly cured softneck stores 6–9 months. Hardneck stores 3–5 months.

---

## Chard (Swiss Chard)

The indestructible green. Chard produces through heat, cold, drought, and neglect. It's the vegetable that forgives.

**Varieties:**

- **Bright Lights** — rainbow stems (red, yellow, orange, pink, white). Gorgeous in the garden and on the plate.
- **Fordhook Giant** — white stems, massive leaves, productive.
- **Ruby Red / Rhubarb** — deep red stems, beautiful contrast in beds.

**Chard Planting:**

- Direct sow or transplant. Sow ½ inch deep, thin to 12 inches apart.
- Plant spring through fall. In the Bay Area, chard produces year-round.

**Care:**

- Moderate water. Chard is surprisingly drought-tolerant for a leafy green.
- Feed monthly with balanced fertilizer or compost side-dress.
- Watch for leaf miners — they tunnel between leaf surfaces, leaving serpentine trails. Remove affected leaves. Row cover prevents the fly from laying eggs.

**Harvest:**

- Cut outer leaves at the base, leaving the center growing. One planting can produce for 6–9 months.
- Young small leaves are tender for salads. Mature leaves are better cooked.

---

## Onions and Leeks

See November planting guide (Chapter 16) for onion details.

**Leeks** deserve special mention for NorCal. They're the sophisticated allium — milder than onions, perfect for soups and gratins, and they grow beautifully through NorCal's winter.

**Leek varieties:**

- **King Richard** — fast (75 days), long shanks, mild.
- **Blue Solaise** — French heirloom, turns blue-purple in cold. Beautiful and flavorful.
- **Musselburgh** — Scottish heirloom, extremely cold-hardy, thick shanks.

**Leek Planting:**

- Start seeds indoors in February. Transplant pencil-thick seedlings in April–May.
- Plant in a 6-inch-deep trench. Fill in gradually as they grow — this blanches the shank.
- Space 6 inches apart.

**Harvest:**

- Harvest when shanks are 1–1.5 inches in diameter. November through February for spring-planted leeks.
- Leeks are extremely cold-hardy — harvest through winter as needed.

---

## Radishes

The instant gratification crop. Seed to table in 25–30 days.

**Varieties:**

- **Cherry Belle** — classic red globe, 22 days.
- **French Breakfast** — elongated, red with white tip, mild. 25 days.
- **Watermelon Radish** — green outside, stunning pink inside. 55 days (fall planting best).
- **Daikon** — long white Asian radish, excellent for NorCal fall/winter gardens.

**Radish Planting:**

- Direct sow ½ inch deep, thin to 2 inches apart.
- Sow every 2 weeks for continuous harvest, September through April.
- Spring-sown radishes bolt quickly in heat — fall/winter is the better season.

**Care:** Minimal. Consistent moisture. That's about it.

**Harvest:** Pull when shoulders are visible at soil surface. Don't let them get oversized — they turn pithy and hot.

---

## Spinach

True spinach (not the imposters — New Zealand spinach, Malabar spinach) is a cool-season crop that bolts the moment it gets warm.

**Varieties:**

- **Bloomsdale Long Standing** — savoy-type, good bolt resistance, classic flavor.
- **Tyee** — semi-savoy, excellent bolt resistance, vigorous.
- **Space** — smooth-leaf, fast, easy to clean.
- **Giant Winter** — extremely cold-hardy, great for NorCal winter gardens.

**Spinach Planting:**

- Direct sow September–February for fall/winter/spring harvest.
- Spinach bolts above 75°F, so it's a cool-season-only crop inland.
- Bay Area fog belt: grow almost year-round.

**Care:** Consistent moisture, light feeding, watch for downy mildew in wet winters.

**Harvest:** Cut outer leaves or harvest whole rosette. Succession-plant for continuous supply.

# Part IV: Mastering the Details

# Chapter 20: Pest and Disease Management

NorCal's Mediterranean climate gives you a genuine advantage in pest and disease management: the dry summers that define our climate also suppress many fungal diseases that plague humid-climate gardeners. Late blight, which devastates tomatoes in the East Coast, is rare here. Powdery mildew, which thrives in our dry-day/cool-night pattern, is our primary fungal concern.

## The NorCal Pest Lineup

### Aphids

Small, soft-bodied, clustered on new growth and leaf undersides. Every NorCal garden has them.

**Control:** Strong water spray from hose knocks them off. Encourage beneficial insects (ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps) by planting flowers near vegetables — sweet alyssum, yarrow, fennel, and coriander are excellent. Neem oil spray for heavy infestations. Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides — they kill the beneficials that control aphids naturally.

### Tomato Hornworms

Large (3–4 inch) green caterpillars that can defoliate a tomato plant in days. Look for dark droppings on leaves below and follow up to find the worm.

**Control:** Hand-pick (they're big enough to grab). If you find one with white cocoons on its back, leave it — those are parasitic wasp eggs that will kill the hornworm and produce more wasps to control future pests.

### Whiteflies

Tiny white flying insects that erupt in clouds when you disturb infested plants. Common in the Sacramento Valley.

**Control:** Yellow sticky traps. Neem oil. Reflective mulch (silver or aluminum) repels them. Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen (lush growth attracts them).

### Squash Bugs

Gray-brown, shield-shaped insects that suck sap from squash and pumpkin plants. Can kill young plants.

**Control:** Hand-pick adults and crush copper-colored egg clusters on leaf undersides. Trap under boards at night (they congregate underneath) and destroy in the morning. Neem oil. Row cover over young plants until flowering.

### Gophers

Welcome to NorCal's most infuriating garden pest. Gophers are endemic to every region and can destroy root crops, pull entire plants underground, and ruin your day.

**Control:**

- **Hardware cloth (½-inch mesh)** on the bottom of raised beds is the gold standard. Line the entire bottom before filling with soil. This is the only 100% reliable method.
- **Gopher baskets** — wire mesh baskets buried with individual plants. Essential for high-value plants.
- **Traps** (Macabee or Cinch traps) — effective but requires skill and persistence.
- **Barn owls** — a single barn owl family eats 3,000+ gophers per year. Install an owl box. Seriously.

### Deer

Wine Country and Foothills gardeners know: deer will eat everything you love and ignore everything you don't.

**Control:**

- **8-foot fence.** The only reliable deer exclusion. Deer can clear a 6-foot fence easily. Wire, welded wire, or poly mesh — all work if 8 feet tall.
- **Electric fence** (2-wire or 3-wire) — effective and less expensive than tall fencing.
- **Deer netting** over individual beds — works for small gardens.
- Repellent sprays (Liquid Fence, Plantskydd) — helpful as a supplement, not a primary strategy. Reapply after rain.

### Snails and Slugs

Wet-winter menace. They emerge after rain and devour seedlings overnight.

**Control:** Iron phosphate bait (Sluggo or equivalent) — organic-approved, safe for pets and wildlife, highly effective. Apply after rain or irrigation. Beer traps work but are less effective at scale. Copper tape around raised beds provides a barrier.

## Disease Management

**Powdery mildew:** White powdery coating on leaves, especially squash, cucumbers, and grapes. Thrives in NorCal's warm days/cool nights cycle. Control: resistant varieties, good air circulation, neem oil, potassium bicarbonate spray, sulfur dust.

**Early blight (tomatoes):** Brown spots on lower leaves, working upward. Caused by soil splash. Control: mulch to prevent splash, remove affected lower leaves, rotate crops, avoid overhead watering.

**Downy mildew:** Yellow patches on leaf tops, fuzzy growth underneath. Common on lettuce and brassicas in wet winters. Control: good spacing for airflow, avoid wetting foliage, resistant varieties.

**Fusarium and Verticillium wilt (tomatoes):** Soil-borne fungi that cause wilting and death. No cure once established. Prevention: rotate crops (3–4 year cycle out of solanaceae), choose resistant varieties (look for F and V after variety name), solarize infested beds.

> **Pro Tip:** The single most effective pest and disease strategy isn't a spray or trap — it's **plant diversity.** A garden with 15–20 different vegetables and interspersed flowers supports a robust ecosystem of beneficial insects, confuses pest-finding mechanisms, and prevents any single problem from devastating your whole harvest.

## Common Mistakes

- **Reaching for pesticides first.** Most NorCal pest problems can be managed with hand-picking, water spray, and beneficial insects. Chemicals should be the last resort.
- **Killing beneficial insects.** That weird bug might be eating your aphids. Learn to identify beneficials before spraying.
- **Ignoring gopher protection.** Line your raised beds with hardware cloth at construction. Retrofitting is nearly impossible.
- **Building a 6-foot deer fence.** If you're going to fence, go to 8 feet. A 6-foot fence is an expensive suggestion that deer will laugh at.

# Chapter 21: Companion Planting and Crop Rotation

## Companion Planting: The Science and the Folklore

Some companion planting is backed by solid evidence. Some is garden mythology. Here's what actually works in NorCal:

**Evidence-based companions:**

| Combination | Why It Works |
|-------------|-------------|
| Tomatoes + basil | Basil repels some tomato pests (hornworm moths). Also convenient for cooking. |
| Brassicas + dill/fennel/cilantro | Attracts parasitic wasps that control cabbage worms. |
| Corn + beans + squash ("Three Sisters") | Corn provides bean trellis, beans fix nitrogen, squash shades soil. |
| Any vegetable + sweet alyssum | Alyssum attracts hoverflies and parasitic wasps — top-tier beneficial insect support. |
| Lettuce in tomato shade | Tomato canopy provides afternoon shade, extending lettuce season. |
| Radishes with carrots | Radishes germinate fast, marking the row; harvested before carrots need the space. |

**Skip these myths:**

- "Marigolds repel everything" — they have some nematode-suppressing effect when grown as a cover crop and tilled in. Simply planting them next to tomatoes does very little.
- "Carrots love tomatoes" — nice book title, minimal evidence.
- "Never plant X next to Y" — most of these prohibitions are unsupported by research.

## Crop Rotation: Why It Matters

Rotating plant families through your beds over a 3–4 year cycle:

- Breaks pest and disease cycles (soil-borne pathogens build up when the same family grows in the same spot)
- Balances soil nutrients (legumes add nitrogen; brassicas and solanaceae deplete it)
- Improves soil structure (deep-rooted crops break up different soil layers than shallow-rooted ones)

**The simple NorCal 4-year rotation:**

Year 1: Legumes (beans, peas, favas) → build nitrogen  
Year 2: Solanaceae (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) → use nitrogen  
Year 3: Brassicas (broccoli, kale, cabbage) → moderate feeders  
Year 4: Root crops + alliums (carrots, beets, onions, garlic) → light feeders  

Even in a small 4-bed garden, this rotation is achievable. Each bed gets each family once every four years.

## Common Mistakes

- **Growing tomatoes in the same bed every year.** Fusarium and Verticillium build up in soil and persist for years. Rotate.
- **Overthinking companion planting.** Plant what you eat. If it also happens to be a good companion, bonus. Don't rearrange your garden around unproven folklore.
- **Not including flowers in the vegetable garden.** Flowers = beneficial insects = fewer pest problems. Sweet alyssum, calendula, and borage are the top three for NorCal vegetable gardens.

# Chapter 22: Season Extension

NorCal's climate is already mild enough that season extension feels almost greedy. But in the Foothills and for warm-season crops on the coast, a few simple techniques can add weeks or months to your productive season.

## Row Covers

**Floating row cover (Agribon AG-19 or similar):** Lightweight fabric draped over wire hoops or directly on plants. Adds 4–6°F frost protection. Lets light and rain through.

- **Use in fall** to extend tomato and pepper harvest through early frosts (Foothills, Wine Country ridgetops).
- **Use in spring** to warm soil and protect early transplants.
- **Use in fog belt** to create a warmer microclimate for tomatoes — essentially a mini greenhouse effect.

## Cold Frames

A bottomless box with a transparent lid (old window, polycarbonate panel, or thick plastic). The simplest greenhouse.

- Place over a raised bed or directly on the ground.
- Opens during the day, closes at night.
- Extends the growing season 4–8 weeks in both directions.
- Perfect for the Foothills where genuine winter limits the cool-season garden.

## Hoop Houses and Low Tunnels

Wire hoops covered with plastic sheeting, creating a tunnel over a garden bed.

- **Low tunnels** (2–3 feet tall) are the DIY favorite. 10-gauge wire hoops, 6-mil greenhouse plastic. Cost: $20–30 per bed.
- **Walk-in hoop houses** (6–8 feet tall) are a bigger investment but transform a Foothills garden into a year-round operation.
- In the Sacramento Valley, a hoop house in summer is an oven — use shade cloth instead of plastic.

## Black Plastic Mulch

Warms soil, suppresses weeds, conserves moisture. Essential for melons, sweet potatoes, and other heat-demanding crops in marginal areas.

- **IRT (infrared-transmitting) mulch** is the premium version: warms soil like black plastic but transmits infrared, warming soil even faster.
- Lay plastic 2 weeks before planting to pre-warm the soil.
- Combine with drip irrigation underneath.
- Not environmentally ideal — use reusable landscape fabric as a more sustainable alternative.

## Wall o' Water and Hot Caps

Individual plant protectors filled with water. The water absorbs daytime heat and releases it at night, creating a warm microclimate around a single plant.

- Gains 2–3 weeks on the early end of tomato season.
- Useful in the Foothills and at higher Wine Country elevations.
- A cheaper DIY version: ring of gallon water jugs around the transplant, draped with row cover.

> **Pro Tip:** In the fog belt, a simple south-facing wall is the best season extender. Plant tomatoes and peppers within 12 inches of a dark-colored, south-facing wall — the thermal mass absorbs heat all day and radiates it back at night. Many San Francisco gardeners grow successful tomatoes this way and nowhere else in their garden.

## Common Mistakes

- **Over-engineering season extension in mild areas.** If you're in the Sacramento Valley or lower Bay Area, you don't need a greenhouse for most crops. Row covers and mulch handle the margins.
- **Not ventilating tunnels and cold frames.** On a sunny day, enclosed spaces overheat fast. Prop open or remove covers when daytime temps exceed 70°F.
- **Ignoring the cheapest season extender: variety selection.** A cold-tolerant tomato variety gets you further than any physical structure. Choose the right varieties first, then add hardware.
