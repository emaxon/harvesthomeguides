# Part I: Getting Started in the Northeast

## Chapter 1: Welcome to Northeast Vegetable Gardening

You picked up this book because you want to grow vegetables in the Northeast. Maybe you just bought a house in Connecticut with a backyard full of rocks and ambition. Maybe you've been gardening in Vermont for years but still can't figure out why your tomatoes look sad every July. Maybe you moved here from somewhere warm and you're staring at frozen ground in March wondering what you've done with your life.

Good news: the Northeast is one of the best places in the country to grow food. Seriously. Those long summer days, reliable rainfall, rich (if rocky) soil, and cool nights produce vegetables with flavor that puts year-round growing regions to shame. A New England tomato in August is a religious experience. A fall harvest of kale after the first frost is sweeter than anything you'll find in a grocery store.

The bad news? You have to earn it.

The Northeast throws everything at you. Frost that arrives early and leaves late. Springs that tease you with 70°F days in March and then dump snow in April. Soil so rocky that every shovelful sounds like you're digging through a gravel pit. Deer that treat your garden like an all-you-can-eat buffet. And a growing season that, in some parts of northern Maine, barely cracks 100 days.

This book is your field manual for all of it.

### What This Book Covers

We're talking about nine states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. That's a huge range — from the Jersey Shore to the Adirondack High Peaks, from downtown Philadelphia to the Canadian border of Vermont. USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7. Growing seasons from 100 days to 200 days.

We'll divide the region into practical sub-regions:

- **Northern New England** (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont): Zones 3b–5b. The shortest seasons, coldest winters, and most challenging — but incredibly rewarding — gardening in the region. Growing seasons of 100–140 days.
- **Southern New England** (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island): Zones 5b–7a. Moderate seasons of 140–180 days. Milder coastal areas, rocky inland soils. The sweet spot for many crops.
- **New York**: Zones 4a–7a. An entire climate gradient in one state. Long Island is practically a different planet from the Adirondacks. NYC area gets 200+ frost-free days; upstate valleys can drop below -30°F.
- **New Jersey**: Zones 6a–7a. Don't sleep on the Garden State — it earned that name. Sandy southern soils, clay in the north, and a surprisingly long growing season.
- **Pennsylvania**: Zones 5b–7a. Philadelphia's mild climate versus the Allegheny Plateau's mountain chill. Incredible agricultural heritage. Limestone valleys and acidic ridgetops.

### What Makes Northeast Gardening Different

If you've gardened in the South or West, forget most of what you know about timing. Here, the calendar revolves around two dates: your **last spring frost** and your **first fall frost**. Everything — and I mean everything — gets planned around those two numbers.

You also can't take sunshine for granted. The Northeast averages 2,400 to 2,800 hours of sun per year, compared to 3,000+ in the Sun Belt. Cloud cover, tree canopy, and short winter days mean every photon counts. Site selection matters more here than almost anywhere else.

And then there's the soil. Oh, the soil. Glaciers scraped across this landscape 10,000 years ago and left behind a gift basket of boulders, gravel, clay, and sand — sometimes all in the same garden bed. The upside? Glacial soil is mineral-rich. The downside? You'll need a pry bar before you need a trowel.

But here's what the Northeast has that many places don't: **water**. Average rainfall of 40–50 inches per year, spread relatively evenly across the growing season. You'll still need to water, but you won't be hauling hoses every single day like folks in the arid West.

### How to Use This Book

This book is organized in four parts:

1. **Getting Started** (you're here) covers the fundamentals: climate, soil, water, and garden planning.
2. **Month-by-Month Guide** walks you through the entire year, January to December, with specific tasks for each month.
3. **Vegetable Profiles** gives you everything you need to know about growing 25+ vegetables, divided into warm-season and cool-season crops.
4. **Mastering the Details** covers pests and diseases, companion planting, season extension (critical up here), and regional resources.

Read it front to back or jump to what you need right now. If you're planting tomorrow, skip to the month-by-month section. If you're planning a new garden, start with soil and garden planning. If deer just ate your bean crop, flip to Part IV.

Let's grow something.

### Common Mistakes

- **Planting too early.** The single most common Northeast gardening mistake. That warm week in April is a trap. Wait for your actual last frost date, then add a week for good measure with warm-season crops.
- **Ignoring soil pH.** Northeast soil tends acidic. If you skip the soil test, you're gardening blind. A $15 test from your county extension office will save you hundreds in wasted effort.
- **Underestimating deer.** If you live outside a major city, assume deer will find your garden. Plan for it from day one, not after they've eaten everything.
- **Not extending the season.** A 120-day growing season becomes 180+ with row covers, cold frames, and smart variety selection. The best Northeast gardeners all do this.

## Chapter 2: Understanding Northeast Climate and Zones

Let's talk about what you're actually dealing with, weather-wise.

The Northeast is defined by four real seasons, and gardeners feel every single one of them. Winters are cold — genuinely cold, not "I need a light jacket" cold. Springs are unpredictable. Summers are warm and humid. Falls are glorious and too short.

### USDA Hardiness Zones

The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map divides the country by average annual minimum winter temperature. In the Northeast, we span zones 3b through 7b:

| Zone | Avg. Min. Temp (°F) | Where You'll Find It |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 3b | -35 to -30 | Northern Maine, Adirondack peaks |
| 4a | -30 to -25 | Northern VT/NH, upstate NY mountains |
| 4b | -25 to -20 | Central Maine, VT valleys, Adirondacks |
| 5a | -20 to -15 | Most of VT/NH, central NY, PA mountains |
| 5b | -15 to -10 | Central MA, CT hills, Finger Lakes |
| 6a | -10 to -5 | Southern CT, coastal MA, central PA, Hudson Valley |
| 6b | -5 to 0 | Long Island, northern NJ, Philadelphia suburbs |
| 7a | 0 to 5 | NYC metro, southern NJ, coastal CT/RI |
| 7b | 5 to 10 | Cape May, NJ (barely — microclimate pockets) |

**Important:** Hardiness zones tell you what **perennials** survive your winters. They say nothing about your growing season length, summer heat, rainfall, or soil. A zone 6a garden in coastal Massachusetts and a zone 6a garden in central Pennsylvania will have very different growing conditions. Use zones as one data point, not the whole picture.

### Frost Dates: The Numbers That Rule Your Life

Your **last spring frost date** and **first fall frost date** define your growing season. Here are averages for major areas:

| Location | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Frost-Free Days |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Portland, ME | May 10 | Oct 5 | 148 |
| Burlington, VT | May 10 | Oct 1 | 144 |
| Concord, NH | May 13 | Sep 28 | 138 |
| Boston, MA | Apr 15 | Nov 5 | 204 |
| Hartford, CT | Apr 25 | Oct 10 | 168 |
| Providence, RI | Apr 15 | Oct 25 | 193 |
| Albany, NY | May 7 | Oct 1 | 147 |
| Syracuse, NY | May 3 | Oct 8 | 158 |
| New York City | Apr 1 | Nov 15 | 228 |
| Newark, NJ | Apr 10 | Oct 30 | 203 |
| Philadelphia, PA | Apr 1 | Nov 10 | 223 |
| Pittsburgh, PA | Apr 30 | Oct 15 | 168 |
| State College, PA | May 5 | Oct 5 | 153 |

Look at the range there. New York City gets 228 frost-free days — that's longer than most of Texas. Northern Vermont gets 144. That 84-day difference is the difference between growing watermelons for fun and fighting to ripen a single tomato.

> **Pro Tip:** Your frost dates are averages. In any given year, frost can arrive two weeks early or two weeks late. Always check the 10-day forecast before making major planting decisions. And keep row covers on hand.

### The Northeast's Weather Personality

**Winter (December–February):** Cold. How cold depends on where you are. Coastal areas moderate by 5–10°F compared to inland valleys. Snow cover is actually good for gardens — it insulates overwintered crops and protects soil biology. Average winter temperatures range from the teens in northern New England to the low 30s in the mid-Atlantic.

**Spring (March–May):** The tease. March gives you hope. April takes it away. May finally delivers — usually. Northeast springs are notorious for false starts. A 75°F day in late March is not permission to plant tomatoes. The jet stream wobbles, cold fronts dive south, and late frosts are the rule, not the exception. The old New England saying is true: "Don't plant until the oak leaves are the size of a squirrel's ear."

**Summer (June–August):** Warm, humid, and surprisingly productive. Average highs in the 80s (sometimes 90s in the mid-Atlantic), with cool nights in the 60s — perfect for most vegetables. Humidity brings disease pressure, especially for tomatoes, squash, and cucurbits. Afternoon thunderstorms provide irregular but welcome rainfall.

**Fall (September–November):** The best-kept secret in Northeast gardening. Cool days, cold nights, virtually no insect pressure, and the sweetest greens you'll ever taste. Fall gardening is underrated here. With planning, you can harvest fresh vegetables well into November — even December with protection.

### Microclimates: Your Secret Weapons

In the Northeast, microclimates matter enormously. A south-facing slope can be a full zone warmer than the valley floor 500 feet away. Urban heat islands push cities a zone or two higher than surrounding suburbs. Coastal areas get buffered by ocean temperatures — warmer in fall, cooler in spring.

Learn your property's microclimates:

- **South-facing walls** absorb and radiate heat. Plant tender crops here. A tomato against a south-facing stone wall in zone 5 performs like zone 6 or 7.
- **Low spots** collect cold air (frost pockets). Cold air is heavy and flows downhill like water. Don't plant your earliest crops in the lowest part of your yard.
- **Wind exposure** strips heat and moisture from plants. Windbreaks — fences, hedges, buildings — create sheltered zones 5–10°F warmer on cold nights.
- **Water bodies** moderate temperature. Near the coast or a large lake, spring comes later (the water is still cold) but fall lasts longer (the water releases stored heat).
- **Tree canopy** reduces available sunlight. Most vegetables need 6–8 hours of direct sun minimum. Full sun (8+) is better. That gorgeous old oak might need to come down — or at least get pruned — if you want productive beds underneath it.

> **Pro Tip:** On a still, clear night in spring or fall, walk your property at dawn. Where frost settles first is your cold pocket. Where it never settles is your warmest microclimate. That's where your tomatoes go.

### Common Mistakes

- **Trusting one warm week.** The Northeast specializes in false springs. A single warm stretch in March or early April is not the signal to plant warm-season crops. Follow your frost dates, not the current temperature.
- **Ignoring your specific location.** Your neighbor three miles away and 200 feet higher in elevation may have a fundamentally different growing season. Don't assume their timing works for you.
- **Forgetting about wind.** Wind chill isn't just for people — it affects plants too. An exposed hilltop garden loses moisture and heat faster than a sheltered one. Factor in wind when siting your beds.
- **Not tracking your own data.** Buy a min/max thermometer. Record your first and last frosts each year. After 3–5 years, you'll have better data than any regional average.

## Chapter 3: Northeast Soils — Rocks, Acid, and Hidden Gold

If you've ever tried to dig a hole in a New England yard, you've met the geology. The Northeast's soil story starts about 20,000 years ago, when mile-thick glaciers scraped across the landscape, grinding bedrock, moving boulders, and depositing a chaotic mix of material as they retreated.

The result? Some of the most variable soil in the country — sometimes within the same garden bed.

### What the Glaciers Left Behind

Northern and central portions of the Northeast (New England, upstate New York, northern Pennsylvania) sit on **glacial till** — an unsorted mix of clay, sand, gravel, and rocks ranging from pebbles to Volkswagen-sized boulders. This is why every old New England farm has stone walls. Farmers didn't build those for aesthetics; they built them because the alternative was plowing around a new boulder every spring.

**Glacial outwash** areas (Long Island, Cape Cod, parts of the Connecticut River valley) have sandier, well-drained soil. Good for root crops, less good for water retention.

**River valleys** (Hudson, Connecticut, Delaware, Susquehanna) have deep, fertile alluvial soil — the best natural garden soil in the region. If your house is in a river valley, count your blessings.

**Coastal plains** (southern New Jersey, southeastern Pennsylvania) have sandy loam — easy to work, warms up fast in spring, but needs organic matter to hold nutrients and moisture.

### The pH Problem

Here's the thing almost every Northeast gardener needs to deal with: **acidic soil.** Most Northeast soil naturally falls between pH 4.5 and 5.5. Most vegetables prefer pH 6.0 to 7.0. That gap matters.

Why so acidic? Heavy rainfall leaches calcium and magnesium from the soil over time. Decomposing oak and pine leaves (abundant in the Northeast) add organic acids. The underlying granite and gneiss bedrock is naturally acidic. Put it all together, and you get soil that's great for blueberries and azaleas but hostile to tomatoes and beans without amendment.

**The fix is lime.** Specifically, agricultural limestone (calcium carbonate) or dolomitic limestone (which adds magnesium too). But here's the critical part: **test your soil before you lime.** Lime is cheap and easy to apply, but over-liming is a real problem. You can't un-lime soil.

| Current pH | Lbs of Limestone per 100 sq ft (Sandy Soil) | Lbs of Limestone per 100 sq ft (Clay Soil) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 4.5 | 12 | 18 |
| 5.0 | 8 | 14 |
| 5.5 | 5 | 10 |
| 6.0 | 2 | 5 |

Target pH 6.5 for most vegetables. Apply lime in fall — it takes 2–3 months to change soil pH significantly. Spring applications help, but you're behind the curve.

> **Pro Tip:** Your state's cooperative extension service will test your soil for $10–$20. The results include specific lime and fertilizer recommendations tailored to your soil. This is the best money you'll spend all year. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and most other Northeast states have extension offices in every county.

### The Exceptions: Limestone Country

Not all Northeast soil is acidic. Central Pennsylvania, the Hudson Valley, and parts of western Connecticut sit on limestone bedrock. These areas may have naturally neutral or even alkaline soil (pH 7.0–7.5). If you're in limestone country, you may not need any lime at all — and adding it could push pH too high.

This is another reason to test before you amend.

### Building Great Garden Soil

Whether you're starting with rocky glacial till, sandy coastal soil, or heavy clay, the prescription is the same: **add organic matter.**

Organic matter — compost, aged manure, leaf mold, cover crops — improves every soil type:

- In **sandy soil**, it holds water and nutrients that would otherwise drain straight through.
- In **clay soil**, it opens up structure, improves drainage, and makes the soil easier to work.
- In **rocky soil**, it fills the gaps between stones and gives roots something to grow in.
- In **every soil**, it feeds the billions of microorganisms that make nutrients available to plants.

**How much?** For new gardens, aim for 3–4 inches of finished compost worked into the top 8–10 inches of soil. For established gardens, add 1–2 inches per year as a top dressing in fall or early spring. You can't really overdo compost (within reason).

### Raised Beds: The Northeast's Best Friend

If your native soil is more rock than soil — and in much of New England, it is — raised beds are the answer. Don't fight the geology. Build on top of it.

**Raised bed advantages in the Northeast:**
- **Soil warms faster in spring.** Raised beds can be 5–10°F warmer than ground level in early spring, giving you a head start.
- **Better drainage.** In wet Northeast springs, raised beds prevent waterlogging.
- **No rocks.** You control exactly what goes in.
- **Better ergonomics.** Less bending, kneeling, and swearing at buried boulders.
- **Easier deer fencing.** Beds give you a defined perimeter to protect.

**Building a raised bed:**

- **Size:** 4 feet wide maximum (so you can reach the center from either side), any length. 8–12 inches deep for most crops, 18–24 inches for deep-rooted crops like carrots and parsnips.
- **Materials:** Untreated cedar or hemlock lasts 8–15 years. Pine is cheaper but rots in 3–5 years. Avoid railroad ties (creosote) and old treated lumber (arsenic). Galvanized steel troughs work great and last decades.
- **Fill:** A good raised bed mix is 60% topsoil, 30% compost, 10% coarse vermiculite or perlite. Or just buy a quality garden soil blend from a local landscape supply company — look for "raised bed mix."
- **Cost:** Figure $3–$5 per cubic foot for quality fill. A 4×8×1-foot bed holds 32 cubic feet. Budget $100–$160 for fill, plus $50–$150 for the frame.

### Dealing with Rocks

Let's be honest: if you're gardening in-ground in New England or upstate New York, you're going to hit rocks. Big ones. Here's the hierarchy of how to deal with them:

1. **Small rocks (fist-sized and under):** Leave them. They actually help with drainage and slowly release minerals. Don't waste time picking out every pebble.
2. **Medium rocks (basketball-sized):** Pry them out with a digging bar. Add them to your stone wall collection.
3. **Large rocks (too big to move):** Build around them. A big boulder in a garden bed is a microclimate feature — it absorbs heat during the day and radiates it at night. Plant tomatoes or peppers on the south side.
4. **Ledge (bedrock):** If you hit ledge within 12 inches of the surface, go to raised beds. You're not going through it.

> **Pro Tip:** When digging a new in-ground bed in rocky soil, use a mattock (a cross between a pickaxe and a hoe) instead of a shovel. It's the right tool for prying rocks loose and breaking through compacted, stony soil. Your back will thank you.

### Soil Testing: Do It

I'm going to say this once more because it's that important: **test your soil.** Every county in every Northeast state has a cooperative extension office that offers affordable soil testing. Most universities in the region also have soil labs.

| State | Soil Lab | Cost | Turnaround |
|-------|---------|------|-----------|
| Connecticut | UConn Soil Nutrient Analysis Lab | $12 | 1–2 weeks |
| Maine | UMaine Analytical Lab | $15 | 2–3 weeks |
| Massachusetts | UMass Soil Testing Lab | $20 | 1–2 weeks |
| New Hampshire | UNH Cooperative Extension | $15 | 2 weeks |
| New York | Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab | $15 | 2–3 weeks |
| New Jersey | Rutgers Soil Testing Lab | $15 | 2–3 weeks |
| Pennsylvania | Penn State Agricultural Lab | $10 | 2 weeks |
| Rhode Island | URI Soil Testing | $12 | 2 weeks |
| Vermont | UVM Agricultural Testing Lab | $15 | 2 weeks |

Test every 2–3 years for established gardens. Test every year when you're first getting started and actively amending.

### Common Mistakes

- **Liming without testing.** "Northeast soil is acidic" is a generalization. YOUR soil might not be. Test first, lime second.
- **Fighting rocks instead of building up.** Life is too short to remove every rock from a New England garden. Raised beds or deep mulch are faster, easier, and more productive.
- **Skipping organic matter.** Compost is not optional in the Northeast. It's the single most impactful thing you can add to any soil type here.
- **Working wet clay soil.** If you have clay, never work it when it's wet — it compacts into bricks. Wait until it crumbles when you squeeze a handful. After the wet Northeast spring, patience pays off.
- **Ignoring drainage.** Northeast gardens get a LOT of rain. If water puddles in your garden after a storm, you have a drainage problem. Raised beds, French drains, or adding massive amounts of compost are your solutions.

---

## Chapter 4: Water in the Northeast

Here's something Northeast gardeners take for granted that gardeners in the West and Southwest would kill for: it rains here. A lot.

Average annual rainfall across the region runs 40–50 inches, and unlike many parts of the country, it's distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. June, July, and August — peak growing season — typically get 3–4 inches per month. That's not quite enough for most vegetable gardens (which want about an inch per week, or roughly 4.3 inches per month), but it's close.

### When You Do Need to Water

Even with regular rainfall, you'll need supplemental watering during:

- **Dry spells.** The Northeast gets them, especially in July and August. Two weeks without rain will stress most vegetables.
- **Establishment.** Transplants and newly germinated seeds need consistent moisture regardless of rainfall.
- **Container gardens.** Pots dry out fast, especially in summer heat. Daily watering is often necessary.
- **Sandy soil.** If you're gardening in coastal areas (Cape Cod, Long Island, the Jersey Shore), sandy soil drains fast and needs more frequent irrigation.
- **Raised beds.** They drain faster than in-ground beds by design. That's great in wet springs but means more watering in dry summers.

### Watering Methods

**Drip irrigation** is the gold standard. Soaker hoses or drip tape laid along your rows deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing waste and keeping foliage dry (which reduces disease — a big deal in the humid Northeast).

A basic drip system for a 4×8 raised bed costs $20–$40 and takes 30 minutes to install. Connect to a timer ($25–$40) and you barely have to think about it.

**Overhead sprinklers** work but waste water through evaporation and wet the foliage, which promotes fungal diseases. If you use sprinklers, water in the early morning so leaves dry quickly.

**Hand watering** with a hose is fine for small gardens and containers. Use a wand attachment for a gentle shower pattern. Avoid blasting the soil surface — it compacts the soil and splashes disease organisms onto lower leaves.

> **Pro Tip:** Water deeply and less frequently rather than shallowly every day. A good soaking every 3–5 days (absent rain) encourages deep root growth. Shallow daily watering keeps roots near the surface where they're vulnerable to heat and drought.

### Rain Barrels and Water Collection

The Northeast's generous rainfall makes rain collection practical and productive. A 1,000-square-foot roof section generates about 600 gallons from a single inch of rain. A typical summer thunderstorm drops half an inch — that's 300 gallons from your roof alone.

A single 55-gallon rain barrel connected to a downspout fills up fast. Consider multiple barrels or a larger cistern (200–500 gallons) if you're serious about it. Most Northeast states allow residential rain collection with no restrictions.

### Dealing with Too Much Water

This is actually the more common problem. Northeast springs are wet. Really wet. March, April, and May can dump 12–15 inches of rain on your garden before you've even planted.

**Strategies for wet gardens:**

- **Raised beds** (yes, them again) keep roots above standing water.
- **Cover crops** planted in fall (winter rye, crimson clover) hold soil in place and absorb excess spring moisture.
- **French drains** along the garden perimeter redirect groundwater.
- **Waiting.** Don't work or plant in waterlogged soil. It damages soil structure and rots seeds. If the soil sticks to your boots, it's too wet.

### Mulch: The Water Manager

Mulch reduces watering needs by 30–50%. In the Northeast, straw, shredded leaves, or grass clippings make excellent vegetable garden mulch. Apply 2–4 inches around (not touching) plant stems after the soil warms in late spring.

**Don't mulch too early.** In the Northeast, cold, wet spring soil needs to warm up before you cover it. Mulching before the soil reaches 60°F for warm-season crops traps cold and moisture, delaying growth. Wait until June for tomatoes, peppers, and other warm-season crops. Mulch cool-season crops whenever you plant them.

### Common Mistakes

- **Not watering at all because "it rains enough."** It often does, but not always. Pay attention during dry spells in July and August.
- **Watering every day regardless.** Overwatering is just as bad as underwatering. Check soil moisture 2 inches down before watering. If it's still damp, skip it.
- **Overhead watering in the evening.** Wet foliage + cool nighttime temperatures = fungal party. Water in the morning if you must use overhead methods.
- **Mulching too early in spring.** Cold, wet soil under thick mulch stays cold and wet. Wait until the soil has warmed.

## Chapter 5: Planning Your Northeast Garden

Planning saves time, money, and heartbreak. An hour with a notebook in January is worth 20 hours of crisis management in July.

### Choosing a Site

The three non-negotiables for a vegetable garden site:

1. **Sunlight: 6–8 hours minimum of direct sun per day.** Full sun (8+) is better. In the Northeast, this often means the south or southwest side of your property, away from large trees. The Northeast's abundant deciduous forests are beautiful — and they cast shade that kills vegetable productivity. Be ruthless about sun. If you have to choose between convenience and sun, choose sun.

2. **Drainage.** Water should not pool in your garden after a rainstorm. If it does, you need raised beds, amended soil, or a different site.

3. **Access to water.** You want a hose bib within reasonable reach. Hauling watering cans across a big yard gets old fast.

**Nice to have:**
- Level ground or a gentle south-facing slope (warms up faster in spring)
- Wind protection from the north and west (prevailing cold winds)
- Close to the house (you'll visit more often, which means problems get caught sooner)
- Away from black walnut trees (they produce juglone, which kills tomatoes, peppers, and many other vegetables within a 50–60 foot radius)

> **Pro Tip:** Black walnut toxicity is a real problem in the Northeast, especially in Pennsylvania and New York where these trees are common. If you have a black walnut within 60 feet of your planned garden, either move the garden or build raised beds with barrier fabric on the bottom to block root contact.

### How Big?

Start smaller than you think you need. A productive 4×8 raised bed or a 100-square-foot in-ground plot produces a surprising amount of food and is manageable for a beginner. A 200–400 square foot garden feeds a family of four a steady stream of salads and sides through the growing season.

**Rule of thumb:** Plan 100–200 square feet of growing space per person in the household. That's enough for fresh eating through summer. Double it if you want to preserve (can, freeze, dry) for winter.

Going from zero to a 1,000-square-foot garden in your first year is a recipe for burnout. Start small, learn your site, expand next year.

### What to Grow

Grow what you eat. This sounds obvious but it's amazing how many first-time gardeners plant things they've never bought at a grocery store. If you don't eat eggplant, don't grow eggplant.

**Best bang for your buck in the Northeast:**

- **Tomatoes.** The flavor difference between a homegrown tomato and a supermarket tomato justifies the entire garden. Grow at least two plants.
- **Lettuce and salad greens.** Expensive at the store, easy to grow, and the Northeast's cool springs and falls are perfect for them. Plant every 2–3 weeks for continuous harvest.
- **Herbs.** Basil, cilantro, parsley, dill. A $3 packet of basil seeds replaces $30+ worth of store-bought basil per season.
- **Snap peas and green beans.** Prolific producers in Northeast conditions. Kids love picking them.
- **Cucumbers and summer squash.** One or two plants produces more than a family can eat. Warning: you will try to give zucchini to your neighbors. They will start avoiding you by August.
- **Kale and chard.** Nearly indestructible, produce for months, and actually taste better after frost.
- **Peppers.** Hot or sweet, they do well in the Northeast's warm summers — especially in the mid-Atlantic.

**Skip (or manage expectations):**

- **Sweet potatoes** in zones 4–5. They need 100+ warm days. Possible with black plastic mulch and season extension, but it's a project.
- **Artichokes.** Not reliably perennial here and need a full season to produce.
- **Okra** in northern New England. It wants sustained heat that Vermont and Maine can't reliably provide.

### Succession Planting

The Northeast's season structure is perfectly set up for **succession planting** — growing quick-maturing cool-season crops before and after the main warm-season crop.

Example timeline for a single bed:

1. **Early April:** Plant lettuce and spinach.
2. **Late May:** Harvest greens. Plant tomatoes.
3. **Late August:** Plant fall lettuce, spinach, or radishes around (or after) tomato plants.
4. **October–November:** Harvest fall greens after tomatoes are done.

You just got three crops from one bed in one season. That's Northeast gardening at its best.

### Crop Rotation

Rotate your crops every year. Don't plant the same vegetable (or family of vegetables) in the same spot two years in a row. This reduces disease buildup and nutrient depletion.

The simple system:

- **Year 1:** Fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers, squash)
- **Year 2:** Leafy crops (lettuce, cabbage, kale, spinach)
- **Year 3:** Root crops (carrots, beets, onions)
- **Year 4:** Legumes (beans, peas) — these fix nitrogen and replenish the soil.
- **Repeat.**

If you only have one or two beds, do your best. Even alternating between two categories helps. Tomatoes in the same spot year after year is a guaranteed recipe for early blight.

### Garden Journals

Keep a garden journal. It doesn't have to be fancy — a spiral notebook works. Record:

- What you planted, when, and where
- When things germinated, flowered, and fruited
- First and last frost dates
- Weather notes (that freak hailstorm in June, the drought in August)
- What worked and what didn't
- Pest and disease observations

After three years, your journal becomes the most accurate gardening guide for YOUR specific garden that exists. No book — including this one — can match that.

### Container Gardening in the Northeast

No yard? Small patio? Terrible soil? Containers are a legitimate way to grow food in the Northeast. Many crops thrive in pots, and containers offer some real advantages: you control the soil, you can move them to chase the sun, and you can bring them indoors or to a sheltered spot when frost threatens.

**Best containers:**
- Minimum 5-gallon (12 inches wide, 12 inches deep) for most crops. Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant want 10–15 gallons.
- Fabric grow bags (Smart Pots, Root Pouches) are excellent — inexpensive ($3–$8), lightweight, great drainage, and air-prune roots.
- Self-watering containers (Earthbox and similar) reduce watering frequency dramatically — worth the investment if you're growing on a deck or balcony.
- Avoid unglazed terra cotta for vegetables — it dries out too fast in Northeast summers.

**Best crops for containers:**
- Tomatoes (determinate types or compact indeterminate like 'Patio,' 'Tumbling Tom,' or 'Bushsteak')
- Peppers (almost all varieties do well — 'Shishito,' 'Jalapeño,' and smaller bell types are excellent)
- Lettuce and salad greens (shallow containers work — even a window box)
- Herbs (basil, cilantro, parsley, dill — a single large pot of mixed herbs is the highest-value container you can grow)
- Bush beans ('Mascotte' is specifically bred for containers)
- Cucumbers (compact varieties like 'Spacemaster' or 'Patio Snacker')
- Radishes (any container at least 6 inches deep)
- Chard and kale (one plant per 5-gallon container)

**Container soil:** Use a quality potting mix (not garden soil — it compacts in containers). Mix in slow-release fertilizer at planting. Container plants need more frequent feeding than in-ground plants because nutrients wash out with watering — liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks during the growing season.

**The watering challenge:** Containers dry out fast, especially in July and August heat. Daily watering is often necessary — twice daily for small pots in full sun. Drip irrigation on a timer is the most reliable solution. Grouping containers together reduces drying from wind exposure.

**Northeast advantage:** Containers on a south-facing patio, deck, or driveway warm up faster in spring than ground-level beds. The reflected heat from pavement or a building wall creates a microclimate that can be a full zone warmer. Apartment gardeners in zone 5 cities may effectively garden in zone 6–7 conditions on a sunny balcony.

### Common Mistakes

- **Too much, too fast.** Start small. A well-maintained small garden out-produces a neglected large one every time.
- **Growing what you don't eat.** The coolest heirloom tomato variety in the world is a waste of space if nobody in your house eats tomatoes.
- **No plan for the shoulder seasons.** The Northeast has excellent spring and fall growing conditions. Ignoring them cuts your productive season in half.
- **Not rotating crops.** Same spot, same crop, same diseases. Move things around.
- **Forgetting about height and shade.** Tall crops (corn, pole beans, tomatoes, trellised cucumbers) cast shade. Plant them on the north side of the garden so they don't shade shorter crops.

# Part II: Month-by-Month Guide

## Chapter 6: January — Dream and Plan

It's January. The garden is buried under snow (or it should be — climate change is making that less reliable). The seed catalogs are arriving, and that's the real reason this month matters.

### What to Do This Month

**Order seeds.** Popular varieties sell out by February. If you want 'Sungold' cherry tomatoes or 'Sugar Snap' peas, order now. Recommended Northeast seed sources:

- **Fedco Seeds** (Waterville, ME) — Worker-owned co-op, great selection, cold-climate focus. A Northeast institution.
- **Johnny's Selected Seeds** (Fairfield, ME) — Professional-grade, excellent trial data, bred for short seasons.
- **High Mowing Organic Seeds** (Hardwick, VT) — 100% organic, strong Northeast varieties.
- **Hudson Valley Seed Company** (Accord, NY) — Art-pack seeds, heirloom focus, local.
- **Pinetree Garden Seeds** (New Gloucester, ME) — Small packets at great prices. Perfect for home gardeners who don't need 500 tomato seeds.
- **Territorial Seed Company** — West Coast company, but excellent short-season varieties that work well here.

**Plan your garden layout.** Sketch your beds. Decide what goes where, keeping crop rotation in mind. Map out succession plantings.

**Review last year's journal.** What worked? What didn't? What are you doing differently this year?

**Check stored supplies.** Inventory your seeds (most last 2–5 years stored in a cool, dry place), pots, soil, fertilizer, and tools. Make a shopping list.

**Maintain tools.** Sharpen pruners, hoes, and shovels. Oil wooden handles. Replace broken or worn-out items. It's cheaper now than in the spring rush.

> **Pro Tip:** When ordering seeds, look for "days to maturity" numbers. In short-season areas (zones 4–5), choose varieties under 75 days for warm-season crops. That 90-day tomato variety that sounds amazing? It might not ripen before your first frost.

### What's Growing

If you planned ahead, **overwintered spinach and mâche** under row covers or in a cold frame may be producing. Garlic planted last October is dormant under snow or mulch. Otherwise, the garden is resting, and so should you (sort of).

### Common Mistakes

- **Waiting until March to order seeds.** Best varieties will be sold out. Order in January.
- **Over-ordering.** A single packet of most seeds is enough for a home garden. You don't need three varieties of everything (okay, maybe tomatoes — you need three varieties of tomatoes).
- **Not planning succession plantings.** January is when you map this out. Once the season starts, there's no time to think strategically.

## Chapter 7: February — Start Seeds, Test Soil

February is when impatient gardeners get into trouble. It's still winter, but the days are getting longer and the itch to plant is real. Channel that energy productively.

### What to Do This Month

**Start seeds indoors (late February):**
- **Onions and leeks:** Start 10–12 weeks before transplanting (mid to late February for a May transplant).
- **Celery and celeriac:** These slow growers need an early start. 10–12 weeks before last frost.
- **Peppers (late month):** Peppers are slow to germinate and grow. Starting in late February gives them a head start. 8–10 weeks before transplant date.

**Don't start yet:** Tomatoes, squash, cucumbers, basil — these grow fast and will get leggy if started too early. Wait until March or April depending on your zone.

**Send in soil tests.** Labs are less busy in February than in April. Results come back faster. This gives you time to buy amendments before the spring rush.

**Build or repair raised beds.** If ground is accessible, February thaws are a good time to get construction done. In much of the region, the ground may still be frozen — work on beds, trellises, and fencing in the garage or workshop.

**Prune fruit trees and bushes.** While they're dormant. Not directly related to vegetable gardening, but most Northeast gardeners grow some fruit too.

### Indoor Seed Starting Basics

You need three things for successful indoor seed starting:

1. **Light.** A sunny south-facing window is marginal in February in the Northeast — the days are too short and the light angle too low. Invest in a **shop light with T5 or LED bulbs**, hung 2–4 inches above seedlings. Run it 14–16 hours per day. A basic setup costs $30–$50 and makes an enormous difference.

2. **Warmth.** Most seeds germinate best at 65–80°F. The top of a refrigerator or a **seedling heat mat** ($15–$25) provides consistent bottom warmth. Once seedlings are up, room temperature (65–70°F) is fine.

3. **Good seed-starting mix.** Use a soilless mix (peat or coco coir based) designed for seed starting. Don't use garden soil — it's too dense and may carry disease. A bag costs $8–$12 and lasts most gardeners the whole season.

**The number one seed starting mistake:** Overwatering. Seeds and seedlings want moist, not wet. If the surface is glistening, it's too wet. Use a spray bottle for watering newly sown seeds. Switch to bottom watering (set pots in a tray of water and let them wick up) once seedlings have their first true leaves.

> **Pro Tip:** Write the variety name and date on every pot or cell. Use a permanent marker on plastic labels or masking tape. You WILL forget what's what within a week. Every gardener thinks they'll remember. None of them do.

### Common Mistakes

- **Starting warm-season seeds too early.** A leggy, root-bound tomato transplant performs worse than one started 4 weeks later. Patience.
- **Insufficient light.** Windowsill seedlings stretch toward the light and develop weak stems. Get a grow light.
- **Skipping soil tests because "I'll do it in spring."** Spring is chaos. Do it now.

## Chapter 8: March — The Awakening

March in the Northeast is a month of contradictions. It can be 60°F one day and snowing the next. The ground may be thawing, or it may still be frozen solid. But the garden season is starting whether the weather cooperates or not.

### What to Do This Month

**Start more seeds indoors:**
- **Tomatoes (mid-March for zones 6–7, late March for zone 5):** 6–8 weeks before last frost. Use varieties suited to your season length.
- **Eggplant:** Same timing as tomatoes. Needs warmth to germinate — use a heat mat.
- **Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (early March):** 6–8 weeks before transplanting outside in mid-April to early May.
- **Lettuce (early March):** For early transplants under row cover. Direct sow outside later.

**Prepare outdoor beds (if ground is thawed):**
- Remove winter mulch from garlic beds — it needs light now.
- Spread compost and rake beds smooth.
- Apply lime if soil tests called for it (ideally done in fall, but early spring is second-best).
- Turn cover crops under if the ground is workable.

**Harden off early transplants (late March, zones 6–7 only):**
If you started onions, leeks, or cool-season crops in February, begin hardening them off in late March — assuming daytime temps are consistently above 45°F. Set them outside in a sheltered spot for increasing periods over 7–10 days.

**Direct sow outdoors (late March, zones 6–7 only):**
- **Peas** (as soon as soil is workable — they germinate in soil as cool as 40°F)
- **Spinach** (same — very cold tolerant)
- **Radishes** (fast germination, cold tolerant)

Zones 4–5: Hold off. Your ground may still be frozen or saturated. Late April is more realistic for outdoor sowing.

> **Pro Tip:** To check if your soil is workable, grab a handful and squeeze it into a ball. Open your hand. If the ball holds together and feels sticky, it's too wet — wait. If it crumbles apart, you're good to go.

### The Spring Frost Dance

In zones 6–7, the last average frost is early to mid-April. In zones 4–5, it's mid-May. But averages are just that — averages. Keep row cover or old bedsheets ready to throw over early plantings if a late frost threatens.

**Row cover (floating fabric like Agribon AG-19)** is the Northeast gardener's best friend from March through May. It lets in light and water while providing 4–8°F of frost protection. Drape it loosely over plants, weigh down the edges with rocks or soil, and leave it on until nighttime temperatures are reliably above freezing.

### Common Mistakes

- **Getting too ambitious too early.** In zones 4–5, March is still winter. Don't force it.
- **Forgetting to harden off seedlings.** Transplants that go from indoor conditions to full outdoor exposure without a transition period will be shocked, sunburned, or killed. Take a week to 10 days to acclimate them.
- **Planting peas too late.** Peas love cold soil and cool air. They decline in heat. Get them in as early as possible — even if it snows on them after planting, they'll be fine.

---

## Chapter 9: April — The Real Start

April is when the Northeast garden season truly begins. Not for everything — but for enough to make you feel like a real gardener again.

### What to Do This Month

**Direct sow outdoors (all zones by late April):**
- Peas (if not done in March)
- Spinach, lettuce, arugula
- Radishes, carrots (mid to late April)
- Beets (late April)
- Chard
- Kale, collards
- Potatoes (plant seed potatoes mid to late April in most areas)
- Onion sets and transplants

**Transplant outdoors (zones 6–7, with protection):**
- Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (early to mid-April with row cover)
- Lettuce transplants
- Onion and leek transplants

**Continue indoor seed starting:**
- Tomatoes (zones 4–5, early April — 6–8 weeks before late May/early June transplant)
- Squash, cucumbers, melons (late April, 3–4 weeks before transplant — these grow FAST indoors and don't like being root-bound)
- Basil (late April)

**Garden maintenance:**
- Weed early. April weeds left unchecked become June nightmares.
- Set up trellises for peas now, while you can still see what you're doing.
- Install deer fencing if you haven't already. Deer browse heavily in spring when natural forage is just emerging.
- Prepare tomato cages, stakes, or trellis systems.

### Potatoes: A Northeast Tradition

Potatoes are one of the great Northeast crops. They thrive in cool weather, acidic soil (pH 5.0–5.5 is actually ideal — one of the few crops that likes it acidic), and our typically moist conditions.

**Planting:** Cut seed potatoes into pieces with 2–3 eyes each. Let them dry for a day or two (this prevents rot). Plant 4 inches deep, 12 inches apart. As plants grow, hill soil or straw around the stems — potatoes form along the buried stem, so more hilling means more potatoes.

**When:** 2–4 weeks before your last frost date. Potatoes tolerate light frost.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Yukon Gold' — buttery, all-purpose, reliable
- 'Kennebec' — classic New England potato, great bakers
- 'Red Norland' — early, waxy, good for boiling
- 'Adirondack Blue' — beautiful, nutritious, conversation starter
- 'Elba' — disease-resistant, great storage potato

> **Pro Tip:** Don't buy seed potatoes from the grocery store. They're often treated with sprout inhibitors and may carry diseases. Buy certified seed potatoes from a garden center or seed catalog. Johnny's and Fedco both have excellent seed potato selections.

### Common Mistakes

- **Planting warm-season crops too early.** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, and cucumbers should NOT go outside in April in any part of the Northeast (unless you're in the NYC metro area or southern Jersey, and even then, late April is pushing it). Soil is too cold and frost risk is too high.
- **Forgetting to thin.** Direct-sown crops like carrots, beets, and lettuce need thinning once seedlings emerge. Crowded plants produce poorly. Thin to recommended spacing when seedlings have 2–3 true leaves.
- **Skipping pea supports.** Even "bush" peas benefit from a short trellis or some pea sticks. Without support, they flop over, reducing air circulation and making harvest miserable.

---

## Chapter 10: May — Full Speed Ahead

May is the big month. The one where you go from a few cool-weather crops to a full-blown garden. By the end of May, everything should be in the ground (or close to it).

### What to Do This Month

**After last frost (mid-May for zones 6–7, late May to early June for zones 4–5):**

Transplant outdoors:
- Tomatoes
- Peppers
- Eggplant
- Basil

Direct sow outdoors:
- Beans (bush and pole) — wait until soil is 60°F+
- Corn (soil temp 60°F+, plant in blocks of at least 4 rows for pollination)
- Cucumbers (soil temp 60°F+)
- Squash and pumpkins (soil temp 60°F+)
- Melons (soil temp 65°F+ — use black plastic mulch to warm soil)

**Continue successive plantings:**
- Lettuce, radishes, and other salad greens every 2–3 weeks
- Bush beans every 2–3 weeks for continuous harvest through summer

**Garden tasks:**
- Mulch around warm-season transplants once soil is warm (late May/early June).
- Install tomato supports at planting time — not after plants are 3 feet tall and falling over.
- Set up drip irrigation.
- Monitor for flea beetles on eggplant and brassicas. They're active early.
- Watch for cutworms — they sever seedlings at the soil line. Paper collars around transplant stems help.

### Transplanting Like a Pro

**The day before transplanting:** Water seedlings thoroughly. If possible, transplant on a cloudy day or in the late afternoon — less transplant shock.

**Tomatoes:** Plant deep. Bury the stem up to the lowest set of leaves. Tomatoes root along the buried stem, creating a stronger plant. This is one of the few plants you should deliberately plant deeper than it was growing in the pot.

**Peppers:** Plant at the same depth they grew in the pot. They don't root from the stem like tomatoes.

**Squash/cucumbers/melons:** Handle gently. They hate root disturbance. Don't break apart the root ball. If starting in peat pots, tear the rim off so it doesn't wick moisture away from the stem.

**Spacing matters.** Crowded plants get less sun, less airflow, and more disease. Here are minimum spacings:

| Crop | Spacing Between Plants | Spacing Between Rows |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Tomatoes (staked) | 18–24" | 36–48" |
| Tomatoes (caged) | 24–36" | 48–60" |
| Peppers | 18" | 24–30" |
| Eggplant | 24" | 30–36" |
| Cucumbers (trellised) | 12" | 36" |
| Summer squash | 24–36" | 48–60" |
| Winter squash | 36–48" | 72–96" |
| Bush beans | 4–6" | 18–24" |
| Pole beans | 6" | 36" |

> **Pro Tip:** Warm the soil before planting heat-lovers. Lay black landscape fabric or black plastic mulch over beds 2–3 weeks before transplanting tomatoes, peppers, or melons. Soil temperature under black plastic can be 8–10°F warmer than bare soil — a game-changer in zone 5.

### The Memorial Day Rule

In much of the Northeast, Memorial Day weekend (late May) is the traditional planting benchmark for warm-season crops. It's a good rule of thumb for zones 5b–6, but check your specific frost dates:

- **Zones 6b–7:** You can usually plant warm-season crops by mid-May.
- **Zones 5a–5b:** Memorial Day to first week of June.
- **Zones 4a–4b:** First two weeks of June. Don't rush it.

### Common Mistakes

- **Transplanting into cold soil.** Even if air temperatures are warm, soil below 55°F stresses warm-season crops. They just sit there, sulking, until the soil warms up. Use a soil thermometer — $10 at any garden center.
- **Forgetting to harden off.** Still applies if you started seeds indoors. A week of gradual outdoor exposure prevents transplant shock.
- **Planting winter squash and pumpkins too close together.** Those little transplants will become 10-foot vines. Give them room.
- **Not having deer protection in place.** By May, deer are hungry and your garden is the freshest salad bar in the neighborhood.

## Chapter 11: June — Growing and Grooming

June is when the garden shifts from planting to maintenance. Most crops are in the ground and growing, and your job transitions to keeping them healthy, fed, and (relatively) weed-free.

### What to Do This Month

**Plant last warm-season crops (early June):**
- Final succession of bush beans
- Late-planted squash and cucumbers (especially in zones 4–5)
- Sweet potato slips (southern areas, zones 6–7)

**Maintenance:**
- **Weed.** Weekly. A hoe is faster than hand-pulling for in-ground beds. In raised beds, hand-pulling is usually easiest. Spend 20 minutes per week now, or 5 hours trying to reclaim the garden in July.
- **Mulch.** Apply 2–4 inches of straw, shredded leaves, or grass clippings around warm-season crops now that the soil is warm. Mulch suppresses weeds, retains moisture, and prevents soil splash (which transmits early blight to tomatoes).
- **Prune tomato suckers.** If you're growing indeterminate tomatoes (most heirloom types), pinch out the suckers — the small shoots that grow in the V between the main stem and branches. This directs energy into fewer, larger fruits and improves air circulation. Leave 2–4 main stems; remove the rest.
- **Side-dress heavy feeders.** Tomatoes, peppers, corn, and squash benefit from a mid-season fertilizer boost. Apply a ring of balanced granular fertilizer (10-10-10) or compost around plants, 6 inches from the stem.
- **Monitor watering.** June can be rainy or dry. Check soil moisture before watering. Aim for 1–1.5 inches of water per week total (rain + irrigation).

**Harvest:**
- Lettuce, spinach, and other greens planted in March/April
- Radishes
- Peas (late June in zones 5–6)
- Strawberries (if you grow them)
- Garlic scapes (the curly green tops of hardneck garlic) — cut them off to direct energy to the bulb. They're delicious sautéed or in pesto.

### The June Bug Report

Insect pressure picks up in June. Keep an eye out for:

- **Colorado potato beetles** on potatoes, eggplant, and tomatoes. Hand-pick adults and larvae. Squash egg clusters (bright orange, found on leaf undersides).
- **Cucumber beetles** on cucumbers, squash, and melons. They transmit bacterial wilt. Use row cover until plants flower, then remove for pollination.
- **Aphids** on almost everything. A strong spray of water knocks them off. Ladybugs and lacewings eat them. Only treat with insecticidal soap if populations are heavy.
- **Cabbage worms** on broccoli, cabbage, kale, and other brassicas. Row cover prevents them. Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) spray kills larvae if they get through.

> **Pro Tip:** Walk your garden every morning with a cup of coffee. Seriously. Five minutes of daily observation catches problems before they become disasters. A few aphids on Monday become a full infestation by Friday if you're not looking.

### Common Mistakes

- **Neglecting weeding.** June is when weeds go from annoying to overwhelming. Stay on top of them weekly.
- **Over-pruning tomatoes.** Remove suckers below the first flower cluster. Above that, let some grow — you want enough foliage to protect fruit from sunscald.
- **Forgetting to harvest.** Lettuce, peas, beans, and squash need regular harvesting to keep producing. Leaving mature fruit on the plant signals the plant to stop making more.
- **Ignoring garlic scapes.** If you grow hardneck garlic, cutting the scapes in June increases bulb size by 20–30%. Plus they're one of the most delicious garden treats of the year.

---

## Chapter 12: July — The Heart of the Season

July is peak garden. Long days, warm nights, and everything growing like crazy. It's also when things can go sideways fast — drought, disease, and bug pressure all peak this month.

### What to Do This Month

**Harvest, harvest, harvest:**
- Tomatoes (first ripe fruit in zones 6–7 by mid-July)
- Cucumbers (pick them small — 6–8 inches — for best flavor)
- Summer squash and zucchini (every other day; they go from perfect to baseball bat in 48 hours)
- Green beans (pick every 2–3 days)
- Peppers (start harvesting green or wait for color)
- Basil (harvest regularly to prevent flowering)
- Early potatoes (dig when plants flower)
- Garlic (mid to late July — harvest when lower 1/3 of leaves have browned)

**Plant for fall:**
- **Late July is when fall gardening begins.** This is the most overlooked moment in the Northeast garden calendar. Count backwards from your first fall frost date:
  - 90 days before first frost: Start broccoli and cauliflower seeds indoors for fall transplant
  - 75 days before: Plan kale, collards, and Brussels sprouts transplants
  - 60 days before: Direct sow fall beets, turnips, and carrots

**Maintenance:**
- **Water consistently.** July droughts are common. Deep water 2–3 times per week if it hasn't rained.
- **Monitor for disease.** Early blight on tomatoes shows up as brown concentric rings on lower leaves. Remove affected leaves immediately. Apply copper fungicide preventively if your area is prone.
- **Check tomato supports.** By July, indeterminate tomatoes are heavy. Reinforce stakes and cages before they collapse.
- **Continue succession planting** bush beans, lettuce (heat-tolerant varieties like 'Jericho' or 'Muir'), and cilantro.

### The Humidity Problem

July and August in the Northeast are humid. Average relative humidity of 70–80% creates ideal conditions for fungal diseases:

- **Early blight** (tomatoes): Dark spots with concentric rings on lower leaves. Prune lower branches, mulch to prevent soil splash, and ensure good airflow.
- **Powdery mildew** (squash, cucumbers): White powdery coating on leaves. Plant resistant varieties, space plants widely, and water at the base — not overhead.
- **Downy mildew** (cucumbers, basil): Yellow patches on leaf surfaces, gray fuzz underneath. Resistant varieties are your best defense.
- **Late blight** (tomatoes, potatoes): The one that caused the Irish Potato Famine. Gray-green water-soaked spots that spread rapidly. Destroy (don't compost) affected plants. Copper fungicide helps preventively but won't cure it.

**Prevention beats treatment.** Good airflow (proper spacing, pruning), drip irrigation (keeps foliage dry), mulch (prevents soil splash), and crop rotation are your front-line defenses.

> **Pro Tip:** For tomatoes, prune the lower 12–18 inches of foliage once plants are established. Early blight spores live in the soil and splash up onto lower leaves during rain. Removing that lower foliage eliminates the pathway.

### Common Mistakes

- **Not planning for fall.** If you wait until September to think about fall gardening, you've missed the window. July is when you start fall crops.
- **Letting squash get too big.** A 12-inch zucchini is a seed log, not food. Harvest summer squash at 6–8 inches for the best texture and flavor.
- **Ignoring early blight symptoms.** It starts small and manageable. Left unchecked, it defoliates the entire plant by August.
- **Under-watering during heat waves.** When temps hit the 90s with low rainfall, double your watering. Stressed plants are more susceptible to disease and pests.

---

## Chapter 13: August — Abundance and Transition

August is harvest month. The kitchen counter is buried in tomatoes. Friends are dodging your calls because they know you're going to show up with a bag of zucchini. This is also the month where the garden starts its transition toward fall.

### What to Do This Month

**Harvest everything:**
- Tomatoes at peak — process what you can't eat fresh (freezing whole tomatoes is the easiest preservation method)
- Sweet corn (when silks turn brown and kernels squirt milky juice when pierced)
- Peppers — both green and colored
- Eggplant (pick when skin is glossy; dull skin means over-ripe and seedy)
- Melons (cantaloupes slip off the vine when ripe; watermelons are trickier — tap for a hollow sound, check the ground spot for yellow)
- Onions (when tops fall over naturally, cure in a dry, shaded spot for 2 weeks)
- Potatoes (main crop — dig after tops die back)

**Fall garden planting (this month is critical):**
- **Direct sow:** Kale, collards, spinach, lettuce, arugula, radishes, turnips, Asian greens (bok choy, tatsoi, mizuna)
- **Transplant:** Broccoli and cauliflower started in July
- **Plant:** Garlic is traditionally planted in October, but start thinking about what varieties you want

**Maintenance:**
- Pull spent crops (early peas, bolted lettuce) and replant immediately with fall crops.
- Top-dress fall plantings with a thin layer of compost.
- Continue watering — August can be dry.
- Order garlic for October planting.
- Start saving seeds from open-pollinated varieties if you're into that.

### Processing the Bounty

If you've done this right, August produces more food than you can eat fresh. Options:

- **Freezing:** Simplest method. Tomatoes, peppers, beans, corn, and herbs all freeze well. Blanch vegetables for 2–3 minutes before freezing (except tomatoes — freeze them whole).
- **Canning:** Tomato sauce, salsa, pickles, and jams. Requires a water bath or pressure canner. Follow USDA-approved recipes for safety.
- **Dehydrating:** Great for herbs, peppers, and tomatoes. A basic dehydrator costs $40–$80.
- **Fermenting:** Sauerkraut from your cabbage, pickles from your cucumbers. Fermented foods are nutritious and practically immortal.
- **Giving it away:** The easiest method. Leave a box at the end of your driveway with a "FREE" sign. It'll be empty by evening.

> **Pro Tip:** Roast a sheet pan of tomatoes, peppers, garlic, and onions at 400°F until caramelized. Blend into sauce. Freeze in quart containers. You now have homemade pasta sauce for months. You're welcome.

### Common Mistakes

- **Giving up on the garden.** August burnout is real. The weeds are winning, the squash bugs are spreading, and it's hot. Don't abandon the garden now — fall is the best growing season in the Northeast, and it starts this month.
- **Not planting fall crops.** Every day you delay past early August reduces your fall harvest. Get those greens in the ground.
- **Composting diseased plants.** If your tomatoes had blight or your squash had powdery mildew, throw affected material in the trash, not the compost pile. Home compost doesn't get hot enough to kill many pathogens.

## Chapter 14: September — The Fall Renaissance

September is glorious. The brutal heat breaks, the nights cool down, and the garden enters its second act. For many Northeast gardeners, September and October are the most enjoyable months in the garden.

### What to Do This Month

**Harvest:**
- Late tomatoes — pick all remaining fruit before first frost (green tomatoes ripen on a sunny windowsill or in a paper bag with an apple)
- Winter squash and pumpkins (harvest when rinds are hard and stems begin to dry — cure in the sun for a week, then store in a cool, dry place at 50–55°F)
- Fall greens — kale, lettuce, spinach, arugula are at their peak now
- Root crops — carrots, beets, turnips, parsnips
- Dry beans (for storage — let pods dry on the vine, then shell)

**Protect from frost:**
- In zones 4–5, first frost can arrive as early as mid-September. Be ready.
- Use row cover (Agribon AG-19 or AG-30) over tender crops to buy 2–4 more weeks.
- Harvest all tender crops (tomatoes, peppers, basil, squash, beans) before a killing frost.
- Leave hardy crops (kale, spinach, Brussels sprouts, root crops, leeks) — they tolerate frost and taste better for it.

**Plant:**
- **Garlic** (late September through October — see October chapter for details)
- **Overwintering spinach** (plant in early September for harvest the following spring)
- **Cover crops** — Winter rye is the classic Northeast cover crop. Sow on any bed you're done with for the season. It prevents erosion, suppresses weeds, adds organic matter, and breaks up compacted soil. Sow at 2–3 lbs per 1,000 square feet.

**Garden cleanup:**
- Remove spent warm-season crops and compost healthy plant material.
- Clean and store tomato cages, stakes, and trellises.
- Begin fall soil amendments — spread compost and lime (if needed) on beds you're closing for the season.

### Why Fall Greens Are Superior

Frost triggers a survival mechanism in cold-tolerant plants: they convert starches to sugars, which act as natural antifreeze. The result is greens that are measurably sweeter after frost than before.

Kale, spinach, collards, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and parsnips all benefit from this process. A kale leaf harvested in October after a few frosts has a fundamentally different — and better — flavor than the same variety harvested in July. This is one of the Northeast's great culinary advantages, and it's free.

> **Pro Tip:** Leave parsnips and carrots in the ground through fall (mulch heavily so they don't freeze solid). Dig them after several hard frosts — they'll be the sweetest root vegetables you've ever tasted. Some gardeners even overwinter them and dig in early spring.

### Common Mistakes

- **Not covering tender crops before frost.** The first frost often comes with 2–3 weeks of warm weather after it. A single night's protection can extend your tomato harvest significantly.
- **Harvesting winter squash too early.** They need a full cure (hard rind, dried stem) to store well. If you can dent the rind with your fingernail, it's not ready.
- **Neglecting fall plantings.** Those greens you planted in August need water and weeding too. Don't ignore them for tomato harvest.
- **Leaving bare soil over winter.** Bare soil erodes, compacts, and loses nutrients. Cover crop it, mulch it, or top-dress with compost.

## Chapter 15: October — The Great Close-Down (and Garlic)

October is about two things: wrapping up the current season and planting for next year. The leaves are turning, the air is crisp, and there's a satisfying quality to putting the garden to bed properly.

### What to Do This Month

**Plant garlic.** This is the single most important October task for Northeast gardeners. Garlic planted in October develops roots through fall, goes dormant under snow, and takes off in spring — producing full-sized bulbs by July.

**How to plant garlic:**

1. **Buy seed garlic** from a reputable source (not the grocery store). Fedco, Johnny's, and many local farms sell seed garlic. **Hardneck varieties** are best for the Northeast — they're more cold-hardy and produce those delicious scapes in June.
2. **When:** 4–6 weeks before the ground freezes. Usually mid-October for most of the region. You want roots to develop but not top growth.
3. **Break bulbs** into individual cloves (don't peel them). Plant the biggest cloves — bigger clove = bigger bulb next year.
4. **Plant** pointy end up, 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart. In well-drained soil amended with compost.
5. **Mulch** heavily — 4–6 inches of straw or shredded leaves. This insulates through winter and suppresses spring weeds.

**Great hardneck varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Music' — large, easy to grow, reliable
- 'German Extra Hardy' — handles brutal cold, strong flavor
- 'Chesnok Red' — outstanding baking garlic
- 'Russian Red' — stores well, beautiful purple stripes
- 'Metechi' — hot and spicy, vigorous grower

**Continue fall harvest:**
- Kale, Brussels sprouts (improve with each frost), leeks, root crops
- Late carrots and parsnips (mulch beds so ground doesn't freeze solid)

**Close down beds:**
- Remove all dead plant material (compost healthy stuff, trash diseased stuff)
- Spread 1–2 inches of compost over empty beds
- Sow cover crops on any bed not already covered
- Apply lime if needed (fall application is ideal — gives it all winter to adjust pH)
- Clean, sharpen, and oil tools for winter storage
- Drain and store hoses and irrigation equipment before freeze

**Set up winter protection:**
- Cold frames over overwintered spinach or lettuce
- Heavy straw mulch over parsnips and carrots you're leaving in the ground
- Burlap windbreaks around any perennial herbs you want to protect

> **Pro Tip:** Save the biggest, best garlic bulb from your July harvest as next year's seed garlic. Over several years, you'll develop a strain perfectly adapted to your garden's conditions. Free seed garlic, selected for your specific soil and climate.

### Common Mistakes

- **Planting garlic too late.** If you wait until the ground is frozen, you've missed the window. Mid-October is ideal for most of the Northeast.
- **Planting grocery store garlic.** It may be the wrong type for your climate, and it may carry diseases. Buy seed garlic from a garden supplier.
- **Skipping fall soil prep.** Compost and lime applied now have all winter to break down and integrate into the soil. Spring-applied amendments are playing catch-up.
- **Not mulching garlic.** Unmulched garlic in zones 4–5 can heave out of the ground during freeze-thaw cycles. 4–6 inches of straw or leaves is insurance.

## Chapter 16: November — Button Up

November is the quiet month. Most of the active gardening is done. What's left is protection, cleanup, and reflection.

### What to Do This Month

**Final harvests:**
- Brussels sprouts (they're still improving — harvest after Thanksgiving for the sweetest ones)
- Kale (still going strong under row cover or in a cold frame — will last through repeated freezes down to the low 20s)
- Leeks (incredibly cold-tolerant — harvest as needed well into December)
- Root crops under mulch
- Spinach under cold frames

**Winter preparation:**
- **Verify all beds are covered** — mulch, cover crops, or tarps. Bare soil is wasted soil.
- **Final tool cleaning.** Coat metal tools with light oil (WD-40 or boiled linseed oil on wood handles).
- **Record your first frost date** in your garden journal.
- **Final notes** — What worked this year? What didn't? What will you change?
- **Order seed catalogs** for the ones you didn't get. Fedco's catalog arrives in December and is basically a gardening textbook.

**For the overwintering garden:**
- Secure cold frames and hoop houses.
- Check row cover integrity — patch holes.
- Ventilate cold frames on warm days (above 50°F) to prevent overheating.

### What Survives November in the Northeast?

With no protection:
- Kale (to about 15°F)
- Collards (to about 15°F)
- Brussels sprouts (to about 10°F)
- Leeks (to about 10°F)
- Parsnips (in-ground, any temperature — the ground insulates them)
- Garlic (dormant — fine under mulch)
- Winter rye cover crop

With cold frame or row cover:
- Spinach
- Mâche (corn salad)
- Claytonia (miner's lettuce)
- Lettuce (sometimes — depends on variety and protection level)
- Carrots (under heavy mulch)

> **Pro Tip:** A simple cold frame — a wooden box with an old window on top — over a bed of spinach will produce fresh greens through December and January, even in zone 5. Eliot Coleman in Maine (zone 5a) harvests greens year-round using nothing more than unheated hoop houses and row cover. If he can do it in Maine, you can do it.

### Common Mistakes

- **Thinking the season is over.** If you have cold frames or row cover, the season isn't over — it's just shifted. Fresh greens in November and December are a luxury most gardeners never experience.
- **Leaving bare soil.** I know I keep saying this. Cover it. Mulch, cover crops, cardboard, tarps — anything is better than bare soil through a Northeast winter.
- **Not cleaning up diseased plant material.** If you left blighted tomato vines in the garden, clean them up now. Disease overwinters in plant debris.

## Chapter 17: December — Rest, Reflect, and Read

December is winter. The garden is sleeping (mostly). You should be too — at least from the active gardening standpoint.

### What to Do This Month

**Harvest (cold frame/hoop house gardeners):**
- Spinach, mâche, claytonia — cold but alive. Harvest on sunny days when plants thaw.

**Planning:**
- Read seed catalogs. Study them. Mark them up. Dream big, then scale back to what's realistic.
- Review your garden journal from the past year.
- Start sketching next year's garden plan, keeping crop rotation in mind.
- Research new techniques — season extension, no-dig methods, new varieties.

**Maintenance:**
- Check on stored crops — winter squash, potatoes, onions, garlic. Remove any that show signs of rot before they spoil the rest.
- Ventilate cold frames on warm, sunny days.
- Enjoy the break. Seriously.

### Holiday Gifts from the Garden

If you preserved the summer's bounty, December is when it pays off:

- Jars of homemade salsa, tomato sauce, or pickles make excellent gifts.
- Braids of garlic (if you grew softneck types).
- Dried herb bundles.
- Seed packets for gardener friends.
- A gift certificate to a seed company.

> **Pro Tip:** December is when seed companies finalize their new offerings for the coming year. Follow Fedco, Johnny's, and High Mowing on social media to catch new variety releases. The early bird gets the interesting new tomato variety.

### Common Mistakes

- **Not resting.** Gardening is physically demanding. The off-season exists for a reason. Recharge.
- **Buying seeds impulsively.** Those catalogs are designed to make everything look irresistible. Refer to your plan. Buy what you need, resist the urge to order 15 tomato varieties.
- **Ignoring stored crops.** One rotten potato can spoil 20 others. Check monthly.

# Part III: Vegetable Profiles

## Chapter 18: Warm-Season Vegetables A–Z

Warm-season crops need warm soil (60°F+) and warm air to thrive. They're killed by frost. In the Northeast, they go in after the last spring frost and come out before the first fall frost. The short-season reality means variety selection matters enormously — always check days to maturity.

### Basil

**The basics:** Annual herb. Needs warm soil and full sun. Intensely frost-tender — even temps in the upper 30s cause damage.

**When to plant:** Transplant after last frost when nighttime temps stay above 50°F. Direct sowing works in zones 6–7 but is too slow for zones 4–5.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil, consistent moisture. Plant 12 inches apart. Pinch growing tips when plants are 6 inches tall to encourage bushy growth. Pinch flower buds immediately when they appear — flowering reduces leaf production and changes flavor.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Genovese' — classic sweet basil, great for pesto
- 'Italian Large Leaf' — big leaves, traditional flavor
- 'Amazel Basil' — downy mildew resistant (important in the humid Northeast)
- 'Lemon' and 'Thai' basil for variety

**Harvest:** Pick leaves regularly from the top down. A well-maintained plant produces all season. Make pesto and freeze it in ice cube trays — basil doesn't dry well, but frozen pesto is perfect.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting too early — basil hates cold soil
- Not pinching flowers — plant shifts from leaf to seed production
- Ignoring downy mildew — the Northeast's #1 basil problem. Resistant varieties are worth it.

---

### Beans (Snap and Dry)

**The basics:** Warm-season annual. Bush types mature in 50–60 days. Pole types in 60–70 days. Both are easy, productive, and fix nitrogen in the soil.

**When to plant:** Direct sow after last frost when soil is 60°F+. Do not start indoors — beans dislike transplanting.

**How to grow:** Full sun, average soil (don't over-fertilize — nitrogen-fixing plants make their own). Sow 1 inch deep, 4–6 inches apart for bush types, 6 inches apart for pole types. Inoculating seeds with rhizobium bacteria before planting boosts nitrogen fixation, especially in new gardens.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Provider' — bush snap bean, cold-tolerant germination, reliable
- 'Contender' — another bulletproof bush variety
- 'Fortex' — pole snap bean, incredibly long tender pods
- 'Kentucky Wonder' — classic pole bean, dual snap/dry use
- 'Jacob's Cattle' — heirloom dry bean, beautiful, great in baked beans
- 'Vermont Cranberry' — classic New England dry bean

**Succession planting:** Plant bush beans every 2–3 weeks from late May through early July for continuous harvest.

**Harvest:** Snap beans: pick when pencil-thick, before seeds bulge. Pick every 2–3 days — leaving mature pods on the plant signals it to stop producing. Dry beans: leave on vine until pods are papery. Shell and dry further indoors if needed.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting too early in cold, wet soil — seeds rot
- Over-fertilizing with nitrogen — all leaf, few beans
- Not picking often enough — reduces yield dramatically

---

### Corn

**The basics:** Warm-season annual. Needs space, heat, and consistent moisture. Not the most space-efficient crop, but nothing beats fresh-picked sweet corn.

**When to plant:** Direct sow after last frost when soil is 65°F+. Usually late May to early June in most of the region.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil, heavy feeding. Plant in **blocks** of at least 4 rows (not long single rows) — corn is wind-pollinated and needs neighboring plants for good ear fill. Space 10–12 inches apart in rows 30–36 inches apart. Side-dress with nitrogen when plants are knee-high.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Golden Bantam' — heirloom, outstanding flavor, 78 days
- 'Bodacious' — yellow, sweet, reliable, 75 days
- 'Peaches and Cream' — bicolor, great flavor, 83 days
- 'Honey Select' — triplesweet, holds quality after harvest, 79 days

**Space consideration:** Four rows of corn, each 10 feet long, takes up about 120 square feet — a significant chunk of a small garden. If space is limited, consider skipping corn and buying from a farmstand.

**Harvest:** When silks turn brown and dry (about 20 days after silks appear). Peel back a small section of husk and press a kernel — if it squirts milky juice, it's ready. If it's watery, wait a few more days. If it's doughy, you're too late.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting in a single long row — poor pollination, half-filled ears
- Not providing enough nitrogen — corn is a very heavy feeder
- Waiting too long to harvest — sweet corn converts sugar to starch rapidly after peak ripeness. Cook it within hours of picking for the best flavor.

---

### Cucumbers

**The basics:** Warm-season annual vine. Fast-growing, productive, and perfect for the Northeast's warm, humid summers.

**When to plant:** Transplant or direct sow after last frost when soil is 65°F+. Usually late May/early June.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil with plenty of compost, consistent moisture. Trellis vining types for better airflow, straighter fruit, and space savings. Bush types work in containers and small spaces. Plant 12 inches apart on a trellis, 36 inches apart if sprawling.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Marketmore 76' — classic dark-green slicer, disease-resistant, developed at Cornell
- 'Diva' — sweet, seedless, parthenocarpic (doesn't need pollination), disease-resistant
- 'Calypso' — excellent pickling variety
- 'Suyo Long' — Asian type, incredibly productive and delicious
- 'National Pickling' — classic pickling cuke

**Harvest:** Pick slicing cucumbers at 6–8 inches, pickling types at 2–4 inches. Pick every 1–2 days — leaving mature fruit on the vine slows production dramatically. Don't let any get yellow.

**Pests:** Cucumber beetles are the main threat. They feed on plants and transmit bacterial wilt (there's no cure — infected plants wilt and die). Use row cover until flowering, then remove for pollination. Kaolin clay spray (Surround) deters beetles on uncovered plants.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Overhead watering — promotes downy mildew. Water at the base.
- Not trellising — ground-grown cukes get more disease, odd shapes, and slug damage
- Letting fruit get too large — seeds develop, skin toughens, plant stops producing

---

### Eggplant

**The basics:** Warm-season annual. Needs heat — more heat than tomatoes. A challenge in northern New England but very doable in zones 6–7 and with some effort in zone 5.

**When to plant:** Transplant after last frost when soil is 70°F+ and nighttime air stays above 55°F. Usually early to mid-June.

**How to grow:** Full sun (all-day sun is ideal), rich soil, black plastic mulch to warm soil. Space 24 inches apart. Eggplant is slow to establish — don't worry if it looks like it's doing nothing for the first few weeks after transplant.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Nadia' — early, productive, classic Italian type, 67 days
- 'Orient Express' — Asian type, slender, incredibly early (58 days — ideal for short seasons)
- 'Rosa Bianca' — beautiful heirloom, creamy flesh, mild flavor (needs 75 days — best in zones 6–7)
- 'Hansel' — mini eggplant, early, great for containers

**The flea beetle problem:** Flea beetles LOVE eggplant. These tiny black jumping beetles chew hundreds of small holes in leaves, weakening young plants. Defense: row cover immediately after transplanting (remove when flowering), neem oil spray, kaolin clay, or just accept some damage — healthy plants outgrow moderate flea beetle pressure.

**Harvest:** Pick when skin is glossy and firm. Press with your thumb — if the indentation springs back, it's ready. If it stays dented, it's over-ripe (and will be bitter and seedy).

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting too early — eggplant in cold soil just sits there looking miserable
- Not warming the soil — black plastic mulch makes a huge difference
- Ignoring flea beetle damage on young plants — severe early damage can stunt the plant permanently

---

### Melons (Cantaloupe, Watermelon, Honeydew)

**The basics:** Warm-season vines. The most heat-demanding major crop. A real challenge in zones 4–5 but rewarding in zones 6–7.

**When to plant:** Transplant after last frost when soil is 70°F+ (usually early to mid-June). Start indoors 3–4 weeks before transplant date.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil, black plastic mulch (essential for melons in the Northeast — warms soil and retains moisture). Space 24–36 inches apart in rows 6 feet apart. Drip irrigation under plastic. Melons need consistent water while growing but reduce watering as fruit ripens — this concentrates flavor.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Sugar Baby' — small watermelon, 75 days, reliable in zones 5+
- 'Blacktail Mountain' — watermelon bred for short seasons (70 days!), zone 4 friendly
- 'Sarah's Choice' — cantaloupe, 76 days, excellent flavor, Johnny's bred
- 'Halona' — cantaloupe, 75 days, disease-resistant
- 'Passport' — honeydew type, 73 days, works in shorter seasons

**The trick:** Start plants indoors, use black plastic mulch, and choose short-season varieties. Together, these three strategies make the difference between success and failure in most of the Northeast.

**Harvest:** Cantaloupes are ripe when the stem slips off with light pressure ("full slip"). Watermelons: look for a yellow ground spot, dry tendril nearest the fruit, and a hollow sound when tapped. Honeydew: skin turns creamy yellow, blossom end gives slightly to pressure.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Choosing varieties bred for the South — they need more heat than we have
- Not using black plastic mulch — soil never gets warm enough without it in zones 4–5
- Overwatering as fruit ripens — waters down flavor

---

### Peppers (Sweet and Hot)

**The basics:** Warm-season annual. Slower than tomatoes to establish but very productive once going. Tolerate Northeast heat and humidity well.

**When to plant:** Transplant after last frost when soil is 65°F+ and nighttime air stays above 55°F. Start seeds indoors 8–10 weeks before transplant.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil, consistent moisture. Space 18 inches apart. Peppers are moderate feeders — too much nitrogen gives you big plants with few peppers. Side-dress with compost or balanced fertilizer when first fruits set.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**
Sweet:
- 'Ace' — early red bell (50 days to green, 70 to red), zone 4–5 friendly
- 'Carmen' — Italian roasting pepper, incredibly productive, 60 days
- 'King of the North' — red bell bred for cold climates, 68 days
- 'Jimmy Nardello' — sweet Italian frying pepper, heirloom, prolific

Hot:
- 'Jalapeño Early' — reliable in short seasons, 60 days
- 'Hungarian Hot Wax' — great for pickling, 60 days
- 'Fish Pepper' — beautiful variegated plant, medium heat, 80 days
- 'Habanero' — possible in zones 6–7 with a long start indoors

**Green vs. colored peppers:** All peppers start green and mature to red, yellow, orange, or other colors. Colored peppers are just ripe green peppers. They take 2–3 weeks longer but taste dramatically better — sweeter, more complex. In short-season areas, plan accordingly.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Starting seeds too late — peppers need 8–10 weeks indoors. Start in late February.
- Cold soil at transplant — peppers stall in soil below 65°F
- Over-fertilizing — big beautiful plants with no peppers

---

### Squash and Pumpkins (Summer and Winter)

**The basics:** Warm-season annuals. Summer squash (zucchini, yellow squash, pattypan) matures fast — 45–55 days. Winter squash (butternut, acorn, delicata, pumpkins) needs 85–110 days. Both are incredibly productive.

**When to plant:** Direct sow or transplant after last frost, soil 65°F+. Late May to early June for most of the region.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil (add extra compost — squash are heavy feeders), lots of space. Bush summer squash needs 3–4 feet per plant. Vining winter squash needs 6–10 feet per plant.

**Varieties for the Northeast:**

Summer:
- 'Dunja' — zucchini, compact, incredibly productive
- 'Costata Romanesco' — Italian ribbed zucchini, superior flavor (worth the space)
- 'Sunburst' — yellow pattypan, fun shape, prolific
- 'Yellow Crookneck' — classic

Winter:
- 'Butternut' (Waltham) — the standard, stores for months, 95 days
- 'Delicata' — doesn't need peeling, sweet, 100 days
- 'Acorn' (Table Queen) — compact vine, 85 days, good for small gardens
- 'Blue Hubbard' — enormous, incredible storage life, New England tradition
- 'Sugar Pie' — pumpkin for pies, 100 days
- 'New England Pie' — another pie pumpkin classic

**The squash vine borer:** This is the #1 enemy of squash in the Northeast. The moth lays eggs at the base of stems in late June/early July. Larvae bore into stems, killing the plant from the inside. Prevention: wrap stems with aluminum foil or row cover at the base. Or grow butternut squash — they're more resistant to borers than other types.

**Harvest:** Summer squash: 6–8 inches, pick every 1–2 days. Winter squash: when rind is hard and resists your fingernail, stem is dry and corky. Cure winter squash in the sun for a week before storing.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting too many zucchini — two plants feed a family and half the neighborhood
- Not watching for squash vine borers — by the time you notice the wilting, it's often too late
- Harvesting winter squash too early — immature squash rots in storage

---

### Tomatoes

**The basics:** The king of the garden. The reason most people start gardening. A perfectly ripe, sun-warm tomato from your own garden is one of life's great pleasures — and you simply cannot buy that experience.

**When to plant:** Transplant after last frost, soil 60°F+, nights consistently above 50°F. Start seeds indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant. Mid-May in zones 6–7, late May to early June in zones 4–5.

**How to grow:** Full sun (absolute minimum 6 hours, 8+ preferred), rich soil, consistent moisture, and support. Tomatoes are heavy feeders — work compost and a balanced fertilizer into the planting hole. Mulch after soil warms. Water at the base (never overhead).

**Determinate vs. Indeterminate:**
- **Determinate** tomatoes grow to a fixed size, set fruit over a 2–3 week period, and stop. Good for canning (everything ripens at once), small spaces, and containers.
- **Indeterminate** tomatoes grow and produce continuously until frost kills them. Most heirloom and cherry tomatoes are indeterminate. They need strong support (6-foot stakes, heavy cages, or trellis systems).

**Varieties for the Northeast:**

Slicers:
- 'Early Girl' — the reliability queen, 52 days, produces even in marginal conditions
- 'Jet Star' — low acid, crack-resistant, 72 days
- 'Celebrity' — disease-resistant, determinate, 70 days
- 'Brandywine' — the heirloom benchmark, incredible flavor, but needs 80+ days and patience

Cherry/Grape:
- 'Sungold' — the best cherry tomato in existence. Sweet, prolific, addictive. 57 days. Grow this one. Non-negotiable.
- 'Juliet' — grape type, crack-resistant, insanely productive, 60 days
- 'Matt's Wild Cherry' — tiny, sweet, disease-resistant, grows like a weed

Paste/Sauce:
- 'San Marzano' — the gold standard for sauce, 80 days (zone 6–7 or season extension)
- 'Amish Paste' — large, versatile, great flavor, 74 days
- 'Plum Regal' — late blight resistant, 75 days (important if your area is prone)

**Disease management:** Tomatoes in the humid Northeast face more disease pressure than almost anywhere. Your defense:
1. **Crop rotation** — never in the same spot two years running
2. **Mulch** — prevents soil splash onto lower leaves
3. **Prune lower foliage** — remove everything below 12 inches
4. **Airflow** — proper spacing and pruning
5. **Water at the base** — wet foliage = fungal buffet
6. **Resistant varieties** — look for codes like V, F, N, T, and LB (late blight) on variety descriptions

**Harvest:** Pick when fully colored and slightly soft to the touch. Or pick at the "breaker" stage (first blush of color) and ripen indoors — the flavor difference is minimal, and you beat the birds and chipmunks.

> **Pro Tip:** At the end of the season, when frost threatens, pick all remaining tomatoes — even green ones. Wrap individually in newspaper and store in a single layer in a cool room. They'll ripen over 2–6 weeks, extending your tomato season into November.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting in cold soil — tomatoes below 55°F soil just stall. Use black plastic mulch in zones 4–5.
- Not pruning indeterminate types — you get a jungle of foliage with fewer, smaller tomatoes and more disease
- Overhead watering — the single biggest disease promoter
- Growing only one variety — diversify. If blight hits 'Brandywine,' you'll be glad you also planted 'Plum Regal'
- Skipping 'Sungold' — seriously, grow 'Sungold'

## Chapter 19: Cool-Season Vegetables A–Z

Cool-season crops are the Northeast's superpower. They thrive in the conditions that warm-season crops merely tolerate: cool air, short days, and frost. These are the crops that extend your season from March through December.

### Beets

**The basics:** Cool-season root crop. Direct sow. Easy, productive, dual-purpose (eat the roots AND the greens).

**When to plant:** Direct sow 2–4 weeks before last frost (April for most areas). Succession plant every 3 weeks until mid-July. Plant again in late July/August for fall harvest.

**How to grow:** Full sun to light shade, loose soil (raised beds are ideal — rocky ground produces funky-shaped roots). Sow seeds 1 inch apart, ½ inch deep. Thin to 3–4 inches apart. Beet "seeds" are actually clusters of 2–4 seeds, so thinning is mandatory.

**Varieties:**
- 'Detroit Dark Red' — the classic, reliable
- 'Chioggia' — candy-striped interior, beautiful, milder flavor
- 'Golden' — yellow, doesn't bleed, sweeter than red varieties
- 'Cylindra' — uniform cylindrical shape, great for slicing

**Harvest:** Pull when 2–3 inches in diameter (larger beets get woody). Greens are harvestable any time — excellent sautéed or in salads.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not thinning — crowded beets stay tiny
- Planting in rocky soil without amending — deformed roots
- Ignoring the greens — beet greens are as nutritious and delicious as the roots

---

### Broccoli and Cauliflower

**The basics:** Cool-season brassicas. Prefer temperatures in the 60s–70s. Go bitter and bolt in sustained heat above 80°F. Perfect for Northeast spring and fall.

**When to plant:** Spring: start indoors 6–8 weeks before last frost, transplant 2–4 weeks before last frost (they tolerate light frost). Fall: start seeds indoors in late June/early July, transplant in August for fall harvest. Fall crops often perform better — fewer pest problems and cooler temps produce sweeter heads.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil, consistent moisture. Heavy feeders — side-dress with nitrogen-rich fertilizer (blood meal, fish emulsion) when heads start forming. Space 18–24 inches apart.

**Varieties:**

Broccoli:
- 'Belstar' — reliable hybrid, great for spring and fall
- 'De Cicco' — heirloom, produces a main head plus many side shoots (extended harvest)
- 'Waltham 29' — cold-tolerant, excellent for fall, developed in Massachusetts

Cauliflower:
- 'Snow Crown' — the most reliable variety for the Northeast, 50 days
- 'Graffiti' — purple, stunning, easier than white types
- 'Cheddar' — orange, high in beta-carotene, novelty with substance

**Harvest:** Cut the main head when florets are tight and before any yellow flowers appear. For broccoli, continue harvesting side shoots for weeks after the main head.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Growing only in spring — fall broccoli is superior in quality and pest resistance
- Not providing enough fertility — stunted plants with tiny heads
- Waiting too long to harvest cauliflower — heads "rice" (become grainy and loose) quickly in warm weather

---

### Cabbage

**The basics:** Cool-season brassica. Incredibly cold-hardy, stores beautifully, and is the foundation for sauerkraut, coleslaw, and stir-fries.

**When to plant:** Spring: transplant 2–4 weeks before last frost. Fall: transplant in late July/August. Direct sowing works but transplanting is more reliable.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil, consistent moisture. Space 18 inches apart for standard heads, 12 inches for mini varieties. Heavy feeder — nitrogen is key.

**Varieties:**
- 'Early Jersey Wakefield' — pointed head, early, sweet (an American heirloom from the 1840s)
- 'Golden Acre' — compact, reliable, 65 days
- 'Storage No. 4' — late-season, keeps for months in a cold cellar
- 'Red Express' — early red cabbage, beautiful and nutritious
- 'Deadon' — stunning savoy-type, incredibly cold-hardy (survives into the 20s)

**Storage:** Late-season cabbage harvested in October can last 3–6 months in a root cellar (32–40°F, 90% humidity) or unheated garage.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Cabbage worms — row cover from transplant day prevents them entirely
- Splitting — caused by uneven watering. Consistent moisture prevents cracked heads.
- Ignoring storage varieties — fresh cabbage in January from your own garden is deeply satisfying

---

### Carrots

**The basics:** Cool-season root crop. Direct sow only — they don't transplant. One of the most rewarding crops to grow at home because homegrown carrots taste nothing like store-bought.

**When to plant:** Direct sow 2–3 weeks before last frost (mid-April for most areas). Succession plant every 3 weeks through July. Plant again in late July for fall harvest and overwintering.

**How to grow:** Full sun, deep loose soil free of rocks and clods (this is the one crop where rocks really are the enemy — they cause forking). Raised beds with sifted soil are ideal. Sow seeds shallowly (¼ inch deep). Keep moist until germination, which takes 10–21 days (patience!). Thin to 2 inches apart.

**Varieties:**
- 'Napoli' — sweet, early, reliable Nantes type
- 'Bolero' — excellent storage carrot, disease-resistant
- 'Danvers 126' — classic American carrot, tolerant of heavier soil
- 'Mokum' — incredibly sweet, great for spring sowing
- 'Purple Haze' — purple exterior, orange core, sweet
- 'Atlas' — round Parisian type, great for shallow or rocky soil (they're round, so rocks don't matter!)

**The overwintering trick:** Carrots planted in late July and left in the ground under heavy mulch (12 inches of straw) can be harvested all winter — just dig through the mulch. Freeze-thaw cycles convert their starches to sugars, making winter-harvested carrots unbelievably sweet.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Letting soil crust over before germination — keep the surface moist with light daily watering or cover with a board until sprouts appear
- Not thinning — crowded carrots stay pencil-thin
- Growing long varieties in rocky or clay soil — use shorter Nantes or Chantenay types, or round 'Atlas'

### Garlic

**The basics:** Plant in October, harvest in July. The longest crop cycle in the garden, but one of the easiest and most rewarding.

(See October chapter for full planting details.)

**Types:**
- **Hardneck:** Best for the Northeast. Cold-hardy, produces scapes, stronger flavor, doesn't store as long (4–6 months).
- **Softneck:** Less cold-hardy but stores for 9–12 months. Works in zones 6–7 but risky in zones 4–5.

**Harvest:** July, when the lower third of leaves have browned. Don't wait until all leaves are brown — the bulb wrapper deteriorates. Cure in a dry, shaded, well-ventilated spot for 2–3 weeks. Trim roots and stems, brush off dirt (don't wash), and store at room temperature.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting too shallow — 2 inches deep minimum, 3–4 inches in zones 4–5
- Not mulching — garlic heaves out of freezing soil without mulch cover
- Harvesting too late — wrappers deteriorate, reducing storage life

### Kale

**The basics:** The ultimate Northeast vegetable. Cold-hardy to about 10°F unprotected, productive for months, nutritious, versatile, and it actually gets better after frost.

**When to plant:** Spring: direct sow or transplant 2–4 weeks before last frost. Fall (preferred): transplant in August for harvest September through December (and beyond with protection).

**How to grow:** Full sun to light shade, average soil, moderate watering. Space 18–24 inches apart. Kale is a light feeder compared to other brassicas. Harvest outer leaves from the bottom up, leaving the growing center intact — the plant keeps producing new leaves for months.

**Varieties:**
- 'Winterbor' — curly type, incredibly cold-hardy, workhorse variety
- 'Red Russian' — flat leaves, tender, beautiful, great raw in salads
- 'Lacinato' (Dinosaur/Tuscan) — dark, bumpy leaves, rich flavor, preferred for cooking
- 'White Russian' — like Red Russian but with white veins, extra cold-hardy

**Why kale loves the Northeast:** Those freezing nights that kill tomatoes make kale produce sugar as antifreeze. Post-frost kale is genuinely delicious — sweet, nutty, with none of the bitterness that turns people off grocery store kale. If you've only had kale from a bag in a supermarket, you haven't had real kale.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Only growing it in spring — fall kale is superior in every way
- Ignoring aphids — they hide in curly kale folds. Check regularly.
- Not harvesting enough — regular picking encourages new growth. Don't be shy.

### Lettuce and Salad Greens

**The basics:** The fastest, easiest crops in the garden. From seed to salad in 30–60 days. Perfect for spring, fall, and succession planting.

**When to plant:** Direct sow as soon as soil is workable (March/April). Continue every 2–3 weeks through May, then skip the heat of summer (lettuce bolts in sustained 80°F+ temps). Resume in late August for fall harvest.

**Types:**
- **Loose-leaf:** Fastest (30–45 days). Cut and come again — harvest outer leaves, plant keeps growing. 'Salad Bowl,' 'Red Sails,' 'Black Seeded Simpson.'
- **Butterhead:** Soft, tender heads, 55–65 days. 'Buttercrunch' (All-America Selections winner, unbeatable), 'Tom Thumb' (tiny heads, great for small spaces).
- **Romaine:** Upright, crunchy, 60–75 days. 'Parris Island Cos,' 'Jericho' (heat-tolerant for summer).
- **Other greens:** Arugula (30 days, peppery), mâche/corn salad (60 days, nutty, extremely cold-hardy), claytonia/miner's lettuce (mild, cold-hardy), mesclun mixes.

**How to grow:** Full sun (light shade in summer helps prevent bolting). Rich soil, consistent moisture. Sow shallowly — lettuce needs light to germinate. Thin or transplant to 6–12 inches apart depending on type.

**The cut-and-come-again method:** Sow a dense band of mixed greens. When leaves reach 4–6 inches, cut the entire band 1 inch above the soil line. The plants regrow for 2–3 more cuttings. This is the fastest way to fill salad bowls.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Only growing lettuce in spring — fall lettuce is equally good and less pest-prone
- Planting too deep — lettuce seed needs light. Just press into the soil surface and water.
- Not succession planting — one big planting gives you two weeks of salad and then nothing. Stagger your plantings.

### Onions and Leeks

**The basics:** Cool-season alliums. Onions need a long season (90–120 days), so they're started early. Leeks are even slower but incredibly cold-hardy and elegant.

**When to plant:** Start onion and leek seeds indoors in February (10–12 weeks before transplant). Transplant outdoors 2–4 weeks before last frost. Or buy onion sets (small bulbs) or transplant bundles from a garden center for a simpler start.

**How to grow:** Full sun, well-drained soil, consistent moisture. Space onion transplants 4–6 inches apart. For leeks, plant in a 6-inch deep trench and hill soil around stems as they grow (this blanches the shaft white).

**Important: day-length matters.** Onions are triggered to form bulbs by day length. The Northeast needs **long-day varieties** (they bulb when days exceed 14–16 hours). Don't plant short-day varieties sold for the South — they'll bulb prematurely and stay tiny.

**Varieties:**

Onions:
- 'Copra' — yellow storage onion, keeps for 10+ months, the gold standard
- 'Patterson' — another excellent long-day storage variety
- 'Red Wing' — red, sweet, good storage
- 'Ailsa Craig' — exhibition-sized sweet onion, less storage

Leeks:
- 'King Richard' — fast, slender, early harvest
- 'Tadorna' — cold-hardy, good for overwintering
- 'Bandit' — extremely cold-hardy, thick shafts

**Storage:** Cure onions in a dry, warm, ventilated spot for 2–3 weeks after harvest (when tops fall over, usually August). Trim roots and tops, store in mesh bags at room temperature. Good storage onions last 6–12 months.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting short-day onion varieties — they don't bulb properly in the Northeast
- Starting from sets instead of seed/transplants for storage onions — sets are more likely to bolt
- Not hilling leeks — unhilled leeks are mostly green with a tiny white portion

---

### Peas

**The basics:** The first crop of spring. Peas love cold weather, hate heat, and belong in every Northeast garden.

**When to plant:** Direct sow as early as the soil can be worked — even 4–6 weeks before last frost. Peas germinate in soil as cool as 40°F. Zones 6–7: March. Zones 4–5: mid to late April.

**How to grow:** Full sun, average soil (don't over-fertilize — peas fix their own nitrogen). Sow 1 inch deep, 2 inches apart in double rows 6 inches apart. Provide a trellis — even bush types benefit from support. All types: netting, string, or pea sticks (twiggy branches stuck in the ground).

**Types:**
- **Snap peas:** Eat pod and all. Sweet, crunchy, addictive. 'Sugar Snap' (the original, 62 days), 'Super Sugar Snap' (improved disease resistance), 'Cascadia' (bush type, 58 days).
- **Snow peas:** Flat pods, eat whole. Great in stir-fries. 'Oregon Sugar Pod II' (68 days), 'Mammoth Melting Sugar' (tall vines, 68 days).
- **Shelling peas:** Shell for the peas inside. More work, incredible flavor. 'Lincoln' (the standard, 67 days), 'Green Arrow' (prolific, 68 days).

**Harvest:** Pick snap and snow peas when pods are plump but before seeds bulge heavily. Shelling peas: when pods are full and round but still bright green. Pick frequently — peas left on the vine stop the plant from producing more.

**Fall peas:** Plant again in late July/early August for a fall harvest. Fall peas are less reliable than spring peas (they may hit a hot spell that knocks them out), but when they work, they're wonderful.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Planting too late — peas decline rapidly in heat above 80°F. Early = better.
- No support — peas on the ground get muddy, diseased, and hard to pick
- Not harvesting daily at peak — a pea that's perfect today is starchy tomorrow

---

### Potatoes

(See April chapter for planting details.)

**Additional varieties for the Northeast:**
- 'Carola' — German butterball, outstanding flavor, good storage
- 'Magic Molly' — deep purple, all-purpose, stores well
- 'Katahdin' — classic Maine potato, excellent for baking and frying
- 'Dark Red Norland' — early, waxy, great for potato salad

**Storage:** Cure freshly dug potatoes in a dark, well-ventilated spot at 50–60°F for 10–14 days. Then store at 35–45°F in a dark place (light turns them green and toxic). A cool basement, root cellar, or unheated garage works. Good storage varieties last 4–8 months.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Exposing tubers to light — green potatoes contain solanine (toxic). Hill soil or mulch around plants and store in darkness.
- Not curing before storage — uncured potatoes have thinner skins and rot faster
- Storing near apples — apples release ethylene gas that causes potatoes to sprout

---

### Radishes

**The basics:** The fastest vegetable in the garden. Spring radishes mature in 22–30 days. Instant gratification for impatient gardeners and perfect for kids.

**When to plant:** Direct sow as soon as soil is workable in spring (March/April). Succession plant every 10 days through May. Skip summer (they bolt). Resume in late August/September for fall.

**How to grow:** Full sun to light shade, loose soil, consistent moisture. Sow ½ inch deep, thin to 1 inch apart. That's it. Radishes are almost impossible to fail.

**Varieties:**
- 'Cherry Belle' — classic red ball, 22 days
- 'French Breakfast' — oblong, red with white tip, mild, 25 days
- 'Easter Egg' — mixed colors, fun for kids, 28 days
- 'Watermelon' — white outside, pink inside, beautiful, 50 days (late-season)
- 'Daikon' — large Asian winter radish, great for fall planting

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting about them — they go from perfect to pithy in a few days. Harvest promptly.
- Planting in summer — heat makes radishes bolt, crack, and taste like fire
- Not thinning — crowded radishes produce all leaf and no root

---

### Spinach

**The basics:** Cool-season green. Loves cold, hates heat. One of the best crops for the Northeast's spring and fall, and one of the few that can be overwintered for early spring harvest.

**When to plant:** Direct sow 4–6 weeks before last frost (March/April). In fall, sow in late August/September. For overwintering, sow in late September — plants establish before winter, go dormant, and explode with growth in early spring (the first fresh thing from your garden, often in March).

**How to grow:** Full sun (light shade in warm weather), rich soil, consistent moisture. Sow ½ inch deep, thin to 4–6 inches apart. Spinach bolts (goes to seed) quickly in heat and long days, so spring spinach has a limited window. Fall and overwintered spinach are more reliable.

**Varieties:**
- 'Bloomsdale Long Standing' — classic heirloom, savoy (crinkled) leaves, good bolt resistance
- 'Space' — smooth leaves, easy to wash, slow to bolt
- 'Giant Winter' — developed for overwintering, incredibly cold-hardy
- 'Renegade' — downy mildew resistant, smooth leaf

**Common Mistakes:**
- Only growing in spring — fall and overwintered spinach are easier and more productive
- Planting too late in spring — spinach needs cool weather to produce well before bolting
- Not using row cover for overwintering — a simple layer of fabric extends spinach harvest by months

---

### Brussels Sprouts

**The basics:** Cool-season brassica. The longest-maturing cole crop (90–110 days), but worth every one of those days. Brussels sprouts are designed for the Northeast — they need frost to reach their potential.

**When to plant:** Start seeds indoors in mid-May to early June. Transplant outside in late June/early July. This timing puts maturity right at first frost in fall, which is exactly when you want it.

**How to grow:** Full sun, rich soil, heavy feeding (treat them like cabbage). Space 24 inches apart in rows 30 inches apart. Tall plants may need staking in windy locations. When sprouts begin forming along the stem (usually by September), some gardeners top the plant — cut off the growing tip — to direct energy into the sprouts rather than new leaf growth. Do this 4–6 weeks before your expected harvest.

**Varieties:**
- 'Long Island Improved' — heirloom, compact, reliable
- 'Jade Cross' — hybrid, vigorous, excellent disease resistance
- 'Dagan' — tall, heavy yielding, late-maturing, superb flavor after frost
- 'Redarling' — red/purple sprouts, beautiful, slightly milder

**The frost factor:** Brussels sprouts harvested before frost taste completely different from those harvested after several hard freezes. Post-frost sprouts are nutty, sweet, and converted many a Thanksgiving dinner skeptic. Leave them in the ground through fall — they tolerate temperatures down to about 10°F. Harvest from the bottom of the stalk upward as sprouts reach 1–1.5 inches in diameter.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Starting too late — if you transplant in August, sprouts won't size up before hard winter
- Harvesting before frost — you're eating a fundamentally inferior vegetable
- Not removing yellowing lower leaves — this improves airflow and directs energy to the sprouts
- Giving up because they look ugly — Brussels sprout plants are not attractive in October. The sprouts are hiding behind tattered leaves. They're in there. Trust the process.

---

### Swiss Chard

**The basics:** The most forgiving green in the garden. Tolerates heat that bolts spinach, survives frost that kills basil, produces for months, and looks gorgeous doing it.

**When to plant:** Direct sow 2 weeks before last frost through midsummer. Or transplant. Chard is flexible.

**How to grow:** Full sun to partial shade, average soil, moderate water. Space 12 inches apart. Harvest outer stalks from the bottom up, leaving the center to keep growing. A single planting in April will produce until hard frost in November.

**Varieties:**
- 'Bright Lights' — rainbow of colored stems (red, yellow, orange, white, pink), beautiful in the garden and on the plate
- 'Fordhook Giant' — the classic, thick white stems, vigorous
- 'Rhubarb' — deep red stems, great flavor

**Common Mistakes:**
- Ignoring chard because it's "boring" — it's one of the most versatile and productive crops in the garden
- Not harvesting regularly — old leaves get tough. Pick them young and often.

---

### Parsnips

**The basics:** Cool-season root crop. The slowest root vegetable (100–130 days), but one of the most rewarding — especially in the Northeast where cold winters unlock their extraordinary sweetness.

**When to plant:** Direct sow in early to mid-spring, as soon as soil can be worked (April). Parsnips have famously slow and erratic germination — 14–28 days is normal. Plant thickly and thin later.

**How to grow:** Full sun, deep, loose, stone-free soil (like carrots, but even more important because parsnips grow 10–14 inches long). Raised beds with sifted soil are ideal. Sow ½ inch deep, thin to 3–4 inches apart. Keep soil consistently moist during the long germination period — if the surface dries and crusts, germination drops dramatically. Some gardeners cover the row with a damp board until sprouts appear.

**Varieties:**
- 'Hollow Crown' — the classic, 105 days, large roots
- 'Harris Model' — smooth, uniform, 120 days
- 'Gladiator' — hybrid, vigorous, good canker resistance

**The magic of overwintering:** Parsnips left in the ground through fall and winter undergo the same starch-to-sugar conversion as carrots and Brussels sprouts, but more dramatically. A parsnip dug in March after a full Northeast winter is one of the sweetest things you'll ever pull from the soil — starchy root vegetables turned to pure candy by months of cold.

Mulch heavily (12 inches of straw) so the ground doesn't freeze so hard you can't dig. Or mark the rows and dig during January or February thaws. Some gardeners plant a flag at each end of the parsnip row so they can find it under snow.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Giving up on germination too early — 3–4 weeks is normal. Be patient.
- Planting in rocky or compacted soil — forked, stunted roots
- Harvesting too early — fall-dug parsnips are fine, but overwintered ones are transcendent
- Not mulching for winter harvest — frozen ground means no digging

---

### Turnips and Rutabagas

**The basics:** Underappreciated cool-season root crops. Turnips mature fast (35–60 days), rutabagas slower (90 days). Both are cold-hardy and great for storage.

**When to plant:** Spring: direct sow 2–4 weeks before last frost. Fall (preferred for both): direct sow in late July/August, 60–90 days before first frost.

**Varieties:**
- 'Hakurei' — Japanese salad turnip, sweet enough to eat raw, 38 days. If you think you don't like turnips, try this one.
- 'Purple Top White Globe' — the classic turnip, reliable, 55 days
- 'American Purple Top' — rutabaga, sweet after frost, 90 days, excellent storage

**Common Mistakes:**
- Never trying 'Hakurei' — this variety single-handedly converts turnip skeptics
- Planting rutabagas too late — they need a full 90 days. Count back from your first frost date.

# Part IV: Mastering the Details

## Chapter 20: Pests and Diseases — With Special Attention to Deer

The Northeast has its share of garden pests and diseases. The humid climate promotes fungal problems, the lush vegetation feeds a robust insect population, and the white-tailed deer population has exploded across the region.

### Deer: The Big One

Let's start with the elephant — or rather, the ungulate — in the room. White-tailed deer are the number one garden pest in the Northeast. The population across the nine-state region exceeds 5 million, and they are remarkably adapted to suburban and exurban environments. If you garden outside a major urban core, you will deal with deer.

**What deer eat:** Almost everything you want to grow. Favorites include beans, peas, lettuce, brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, kale), sweet potato vines, hostas, and tulips. They'll also eat tomato and pepper plants when other food is scarce.

**What deer avoid:** Strongly aromatic or prickly plants. Onions, garlic, chives, herbs (rosemary, sage, thyme, lavender), hot peppers, and most nightshade foliage. But a starving deer will eat anything — "deer-resistant" means "deer eat it last."

**The only reliable solution: fencing.**

A proper deer fence is 7–8 feet tall. Deer can jump 6 feet without breaking a sweat, and motivated deer have been documented clearing 8 feet. Your options:

- **Woven wire or welded wire fence, 8 feet tall.** The gold standard. Effective, long-lasting, and not as ugly as it sounds. Cost: $3–$6 per linear foot for materials, plus posts.
- **Polypropylene deer netting, 7–8 feet tall.** Cheaper ($0.50–$1 per linear foot), nearly invisible, less durable (5–8 year lifespan). Attach to metal T-posts or wooden posts.
- **Electric fence.** Highly effective. A single-strand electric fence baited with peanut butter (seriously — smear peanut butter on aluminum foil flags attached to the wire; deer investigate, get shocked, learn fast) can deter deer. Two to three strands at different heights are even better. Cost: $100–$300 for a small garden setup.
- **Double fence system.** Two 4-foot fences spaced 4 feet apart. Deer can jump high OR far, but not both at once. Effective and doesn't require an 8-foot structure.

**Less reliable methods:**
- **Repellent sprays** (commercial products like Liquid Fence, Plantskydd, or homemade mixtures of eggs and garlic). They work temporarily, need constant reapplication (especially after rain, which is frequent in the Northeast), and deer habituate to them over time. Useful as a supplement to fencing, not a replacement.
- **Motion-activated sprinklers** (Orbit Yard Enforcer is a popular brand). Somewhat effective. Deer sometimes learn to walk around them.
- **Dogs.** A dog that patrols your yard at night is a surprisingly effective deer deterrent. Not a perfect solution, but helpful.
- **Human hair, soap, dryer sheets, wind chimes.** Minimally effective. Deer habituate within days.

> **Pro Tip:** If you can only fence part of your property, fence the garden. A 4×8 raised bed surrounded by 7-foot deer netting on a frame is a manageable DIY project. Protect what matters most and accept some damage to ornamental plantings.

### Common Insect Pests

**Aphids:** Soft-bodied, pear-shaped insects that cluster on new growth and leaf undersides. Colors vary: green, black, gray, pink. They suck plant sap and excrete sticky honeydew. **Treatment:** Strong water spray knocks them off. Ladybugs and lacewings eat them. Insecticidal soap for severe infestations.

**Cabbage worms (Imported Cabbageworm):** Green caterpillars that devour brassica leaves (broccoli, cabbage, kale, cauliflower). White butterflies fluttering around your garden in spring are laying eggs. **Treatment:** Row cover prevents them. Bt spray (Bacillus thuringiensis) kills larvae. Hand-pick.

**Colorado potato beetles:** Distinctive orange-and-black striped beetles and their red-orange larvae. Devastating to potatoes, eggplant, and sometimes tomatoes. **Treatment:** Hand-pick adults and larvae. Crush bright orange egg masses on leaf undersides. Spinosad spray for heavy infestations. Mulch heavily — adult beetles emerge from the soil in spring, and thick mulch slows them.

**Cucumber beetles (Striped and Spotted):** Small yellow-green beetles with black stripes or spots. Feed on cucurbits and transmit bacterial wilt. **Treatment:** Row cover until flowering. Kaolin clay spray. Trap crops (plant Blue Hubbard squash as a sacrificial trap crop — beetles prefer it, then hand-pick or spray only the trap crop).

**Flea beetles:** Tiny black jumping beetles that chew small round holes in leaves, especially eggplant, brassicas, and radishes. **Treatment:** Row cover, neem oil, kaolin clay. Plants usually outgrow moderate damage.

**Squash vine borers:** Moth larvae that bore into squash stems, causing sudden wilt and death. **Treatment:** Wrap stem bases with aluminum foil. Row cover until flowering. Inject Bt into the stem with a syringe if you catch it early. Grow butternut squash (resistant) instead of zucchini and other susceptible types.

**Tomato hornworms:** Large green caterpillars (3–4 inches) that can defoliate a tomato plant overnight. **Treatment:** Hand-pick (look for dark droppings on leaves below the caterpillar). If you see a hornworm covered in white rice-like projections, leave it — those are parasitic wasp cocoons that will kill the caterpillar and produce more wasps.

### Common Diseases

**Early blight (Alternaria):** The most common tomato disease in the Northeast. Dark brown spots with concentric rings on lower leaves, progressing upward. **Management:** Remove affected leaves. Mulch. Prune lower foliage. Copper fungicide preventively. Crop rotation. Resistant varieties.

**Late blight (Phytophthora infestans):** The destroyer. Affects tomatoes and potatoes. Gray-green water-soaked lesions that spread explosively in cool, wet weather. Can destroy a garden in days. **Management:** Destroy (don't compost) affected plants. Copper fungicide preventively. Plant resistant varieties ('Defiant,' 'Plum Regal,' 'Mountain Magic'). Monitor USAblight.org for regional outbreak tracking.

**Powdery mildew:** White powdery coating on leaves of squash, cucumbers, and phlox. Weakens plants but rarely kills them. **Management:** Resistant varieties. Proper spacing for airflow. Potassium bicarbonate spray (1 Tbsp per gallon of water plus a drop of soap) at first signs.

**Downy mildew:** Yellow patches on leaf surfaces, gray-purple fuzz underneath. Devastating to basil and cucurbits. **Management:** Resistant varieties ('Amazel' basil, 'Bristol' and 'DMR' cucumbers). Good airflow. Preventive copper sprays.

**Septoria leaf spot:** Small brown spots with gray centers on tomato leaves. Similar progression to early blight. **Management:** Same as early blight — remove affected foliage, mulch, rotate, spray copper preventively.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

The philosophy that ties it all together:

1. **Prevention first.** Healthy soil, good spacing, resistant varieties, crop rotation, and row cover prevent most problems.
2. **Monitor.** Walk the garden daily. Catch problems early.
3. **Physical controls first.** Hand-pick, use barriers (row cover, fencing), water spray.
4. **Biological controls.** Encourage beneficial insects (ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps, ground beetles). Don't spray broad-spectrum insecticides that kill everything.
5. **Targeted sprays last.** When you must spray, use the most targeted option: Bt for caterpillars, spinosad for beetles, insecticidal soap for soft-bodied insects, copper for fungal diseases.

### Common Mistakes

- **No deer plan.** Hoping deer won't find your garden is not a plan. If deer are in your area, fence before you plant.
- **Spraying at the first sign of any bug.** Most insects are harmless or beneficial. Only treat confirmed pest problems.
- **Ignoring disease until it's advanced.** Removing a few blighted leaves in July saves the plant. Ignoring them until August means a dead plant.
- **Composting diseased material.** Blight, wilt, and other diseases survive in home compost piles. Trash it.

## Chapter 21: Companion Planting and Garden Ecology

Companion planting is the practice of growing certain plants together for mutual benefit — pest deterrence, improved pollination, soil enhancement, or simply efficient use of space.

Some companion planting claims are backed by solid research. Others are garden folklore with thin evidence. I'll focus on the proven and practical.

### What Actually Works

**Three Sisters (Corn, Beans, Squash):** The classic Native American polyculture, and it's genuinely brilliant. Corn provides a trellis for beans. Beans fix nitrogen that feeds the corn. Squash shades the ground, suppressing weeds and retaining moisture. Plant corn first, beans a week later at the base of corn stalks, and squash between corn hills.

**Basil + Tomatoes:** Not just a kitchen pairing. Basil may deter thrips and aphids from tomatoes, and the combination uses garden space efficiently. The science is mixed on pest deterrence, but it doesn't hurt and the kitchen synergy is real.

**Marigolds:** French marigolds (Tagetes patula) release compounds from their roots that suppress root-knot nematodes. This is well-documented science. Plant them among tomatoes, peppers, and other susceptible crops. They also attract beneficial insects. Not just decoration — functional pest management.

**Alliums + Brassicas:** Onions, garlic, and chives planted near cabbage-family crops may confuse and deter cabbage moths. The strong scent disrupts the moths' ability to locate their preferred host plants. Some evidence supports this; it's worth trying.

**Cover crops as companions:** White clover planted as a living mulch under corn or between garden rows fixes nitrogen, suppresses weeds, and attracts beneficial insects. Crimson clover between tomato rows does the same.

**Flowers for pollinators and beneficials:** Alyssum, dill, fennel, cilantro (let it bolt), yarrow, and sunflowers attract pollinators and predatory insects. Plant them at garden borders or interspersed among vegetables. A garden with flowers is not just prettier — it's more productive.

### What Doesn't Work (or Isn't Proven)

**"Tomatoes and peppers should never be near each other."** Both are nightshades with similar needs and diseases. The concern is cross-disease, but crop rotation handles this — there's no evidence that proximity in a single season increases disease.

**"Carrots love tomatoes."** A popular book title, but the evidence for this specific pairing improving either crop is thin. It doesn't hurt, but don't rearrange your garden for it.

**Most elaborate companion planting charts.** If someone claims that planting fennel near anything kills the other plant, or that dill sabotages carrots, take it with a grain of salt. Most of these claims lack controlled studies.

### Practical Interplanting for Space Efficiency

Forget folklore — interplanting for space efficiency is always practical:

- **Quick crops between slow crops.** Radishes and lettuce between tomato transplants — harvested before tomatoes need the space.
- **Vertical + ground.** Pole beans or cucumbers on a trellis with lettuce or spinach in the shade underneath.
- **Shallow + deep roots.** Lettuce (shallow) with carrots or parsnips (deep) — they access different soil layers.
- **Nitrogen fixers + heavy feeders.** Beans near corn, peas near brassicas. The legumes feed the soil; the heavy feeders use it.

### Common Mistakes

- **Overcomplicating it.** Companion planting should make your garden simpler, not harder. If a companion planting plan requires a spreadsheet, you've gone too far.
- **Letting companion planting override basic needs.** Sun, water, and spacing matter more than which plant is next to which. Get the fundamentals right first.
- **Ignoring beneficial insects.** The most important "companion" in your garden isn't a plant — it's the army of ladybugs, ground beetles, parasitic wasps, and spiders that eat your pests for free. Don't kill them with broad-spectrum sprays.

## Chapter 22: Season Extension — The Northeast Gardener's Superpower

If there's one chapter in this book that can transform your gardening, it's this one. Season extension is the practice of using simple structures and techniques to grow food beyond your natural frost-free window — and in the Northeast, where the growing season can feel painfully short, it's the difference between growing food for four months and growing food for eight, nine, or even twelve months.

Eliot Coleman, farming in Harborside, Maine (zone 5a), harvests fresh greens year-round using nothing more than unheated hoop houses and row cover. No supplemental heat. No high-tech equipment. If he can do it at latitude 44°N in coastal Maine, you can do it wherever you are in the Northeast.

### The Tools

**Row cover (floating fabric):**
The simplest and cheapest season extension tool. Spun-bonded polypropylene fabric draped directly over plants or supported on hoops.

| Weight | Brand Example | Frost Protection | Light Transmission | Best Use |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Lightweight (0.5 oz/yd²) | Agribon AG-15 | 2–4°F | 90% | Insect barrier, light frost |
| Medium (1.0 oz/yd²) | Agribon AG-30 | 6–8°F | 70% | Spring/fall frost protection |
| Heavy (1.5 oz/yd²) | Agribon AG-50 | 8–12°F | 50% | Winter growing, hard frost |

Cost: $15–$40 for a 10×25 foot piece. Reusable for 2–3 seasons with care.

**Cold frames:**
A bottomless box (wood, straw bales, or cinder blocks) topped with a transparent lid (old window, polycarbonate panel, or heavy-duty plastic). Simple, effective, and inexpensive.

A cold frame in the Northeast provides 10–15°F of frost protection and creates a microclimate 1–2 zones warmer inside. A cold frame in zone 5 performs like a zone 6–7 garden.

**DIY cold frame:**
- Build a box from 2×12 lumber: 4 feet deep × 3 feet wide (sized to fit a standard window frame). Back wall 18 inches high, front wall 12 inches (creates a slope for water runoff and sun angle).
- Top with an old window or a piece of twin-wall polycarbonate ($20 at a building supply store).
- Orient facing south.
- Cost: $30–$80 with scrap materials.

**Critical:** Ventilate cold frames on sunny days when interior temperature exceeds 70°F. Open the lid, prop it with a stick, or install an automatic vent opener ($25–$35 — a temperature-activated piston that lifts the lid for you). An unventilated cold frame on a sunny February day can exceed 100°F inside and cook your plants.

**Low tunnels (caterpillar tunnels):**
Wire hoops (9- or 10-gauge wire bent into U-shapes) stuck into the ground over a garden bed, covered with row cover or greenhouse plastic. Essentially a portable, flexible cold frame.

- Cover a 4-foot-wide bed with hoops every 4 feet.
- Drape row cover or 6-mil greenhouse plastic over the top.
- Secure edges with sandbags, clips, or buried edges.
- Cost: $1–$2 per hoop, plus covering material. Under $50 for a 20-foot bed.

Low tunnels with heavy row cover provide 6–10°F of frost protection. With greenhouse plastic, they create a mini greenhouse that can keep hardy greens growing through November and December.

**High tunnels (hoop houses):**
Walk-in structures, typically 10–30 feet wide and any length, covered in greenhouse plastic. The serious season extender.

A high tunnel in the Northeast extends the growing season by 4–8 weeks on each end. Tomatoes can go in 3–4 weeks earlier and produce 3–4 weeks later. Greens can grow nearly year-round.

High tunnels are a significant investment ($1,000–$5,000+ for a home-garden-sized structure), but the USDA NRCS offers cost-share programs (EQIP) that can cover up to 75% of the cost. Check with your local NRCS office.

### Season Extension Strategies

**Spring (gaining 2–6 weeks):**
- Pre-warm soil with black plastic mulch 2–3 weeks before planting.
- Transplant warm-season crops under row cover or into low tunnels.
- Start cool-season crops 4–6 weeks before last frost under row cover.
- Use Wall O' Waters or similar water-filled plant protectors around individual tomato or pepper transplants — they provide 10–15°F of frost protection.

**Fall (gaining 4–8 weeks):**
- Cover mature warm-season crops with row cover at first frost threat — this can extend tomato harvest by 2–4 weeks.
- Plant cold-hardy greens in August for harvest through November and December.
- Use cold frames and low tunnels to protect fall plantings.
- Mulch root crops heavily for in-ground winter storage.

**Winter (yes, winter):**
- Under a cold frame or low tunnel, these crops survive Northeast winters and provide periodic harvest on mild days:
  - Spinach
  - Mâche (corn salad)
  - Claytonia (miner's lettuce)
  - Kale (under protection)
  - Carrots (under heavy mulch)
  - Leeks
  - Parsnips
- Plants don't actively grow when day length drops below 10 hours (roughly November through January in the Northeast), but they stay alive under protection and can be harvested. Growth resumes in February as days lengthen.
- Eliot Coleman's concept: **two layers of protection** (row cover inside a hoop house or cold frame inside a greenhouse) creates the equivalent of moving your garden 1.5 zones south. In practice, zone 5 with two layers of protection approximates zone 7 — mild enough for many hardy greens.

### The Overwintering Calendar

For winter harvest, plant these crops in **August and September** so they're mature before the short days of November shut down growth:

| Crop | Plant By | Survives To (°F) | Protection Needed |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Spinach | Sep 15 | 10°F | Cold frame or heavy row cover |
| Mâche | Sep 15 | 5°F | Cold frame |
| Claytonia | Sep 1 | 5°F | Cold frame |
| Kale | Aug 15 | 10°F | Row cover |
| Carrots | Jul 15 | 15°F (in ground) | Heavy straw mulch |
| Leeks | Jun 1 (transplant) | 10°F | Straw mulch |
| Parsnips | Jun 1 | Any (in ground) | Straw mulch |
| Scallions | Aug 15 | 15°F | Cold frame |
| Garlic (green) | Oct 15 | Dormant | Straw mulch |

### Common Mistakes

- **Thinking season extension is complicated.** A $20 piece of row cover draped over hoops extends your season by a month. Start simple.
- **Not ventilating cold frames.** Plants in an unventilated cold frame on a sunny day cook. Vent when it's above 50°F outside.
- **Starting winter crops too late.** Plants must be mature by early November — growth essentially stops until February. Plant in August and September, not October.
- **Ignoring the fall opportunity.** Season extension isn't just about starting earlier in spring. Extending into fall and winter is actually easier and more productive in the Northeast.

### Local Seed and Supply Sources

Beyond the mail-order companies listed in January, these regional sources are worth knowing:

- **Agway/Southern States** — Farm and garden supply stores throughout the region with locally appropriate seed, soil, and tools.
- **Local farm stands and garden centers** — Many sell locally grown transplants hardened off for your area. Better adapted than big-box store plants shipped from the South.
- **Seed libraries** — Many public libraries in the Northeast have seed libraries with locally adapted, open-pollinated varieties. Free seeds, curated for your region.
- **Seed swaps** — Winter events organized by garden clubs and community gardens. Great way to find unusual varieties and connect with local gardeners.

### Online Resources

- **USAblight.org** — Real-time late blight tracking. Essential for tomato and potato growers.
- **Growing Degree Day calculators** (available through most state extension services) — Track accumulated heat units for your area.
- **NOAA weather.gov** — Most accurate frost forecasts.
- **Your state's extension vegetable growing guides** — Free, research-based, region-specific. Better than most books (including, arguably, parts of this one).

### Common Mistakes

- **Not using your extension service.** It's free (or nearly so), it's local, and it's backed by research. There is no better resource for your specific area.
- **Relying only on national gardening advice.** A tip from a gardening magazine based in California or Florida may not apply to the Northeast. Always filter through your regional context.
- **Not connecting with local gardeners.** Join a garden club, community garden, or online local gardening group (Facebook groups for your state or county). Local knowledge from experienced gardeners in your area is invaluable.

## Afterword: The Northeast Gardening Life

Growing food in the Northeast is not the easiest path. You could garden in Zone 9 and never worry about frost dates, rocky soil, or 144-day growing seasons. You could buy a house in the Central Valley of California and grow tomatoes from February to November without breaking a sweat.

But you'd miss the best parts.

You'd miss the first crocus pushing through snow in March, the sign that says "hang on, it's coming." You'd miss the absolutely electric feeling of eating the first pea off the vine in June, after months of cold and waiting. You'd miss the incomparable flavor of a tomato that ripened under long July days and cool August nights — a flavor that only exists in places where the season is short enough to make each fruit precious.

You'd miss kale sweetened by November frost, parsnips dug from frozen ground, and the quiet satisfaction of eating salad greens from your cold frame while snow falls on the other side of the glass.

The Northeast makes you earn your harvest. And that's exactly what makes it worth having.

See you in the garden.
