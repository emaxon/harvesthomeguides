# Part I: Getting Started on the Great Plains

# Chapter 1: Why the Great Plains Are Different

You looked outside today and watched a trash can lid blow across three counties. Welcome to gardening on the Great Plains.

This is a region that routinely delivers 60°F on Tuesday and a blizzard on Thursday. Where the wind doesn't stop — it just changes direction. Where the soil beneath your feet was once the bottom of an ancient sea, and it remembers. And where, despite all of that, people have been coaxing food from the ground for thousands of years. You can do it too. You just need the right playbook.

This book covers five states — Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and South Dakota — spanning USDA Hardiness Zones 4a through 7b. That's an enormous range of growing conditions, from the brutal northern winters of Bismarck where the ground freezes four feet deep, to the long, muggy summers of southern Oklahoma where you're practically gardening in the South. What ties it all together is the prairie: the wind, the wide-open sky, the dramatic swings, and soil that can be either your greatest asset or your biggest headache.

Generic gardening books won't cut it here. The advice your cousin in Virginia follows will fail spectacularly in Wichita. This book is built for your dirt, your wind, your weather, and your specific frustrations.

## Five States, Four Growing Regions

Throughout this book, we'll reference four distinct growing regions. Find yours.

### Northern Plains (USDA Zones 4a–4b)

**States:** North Dakota, northern South Dakota  
**Last spring frost:** May 10–25  
**First fall frost:** September 15–October 1  
**Frost-free days:** 110–135

This is the most challenging growing environment in the book, and the most rewarding when you get it right. You've got a compressed growing season, extreme winter cold (-30°F is not unusual), and wind that crosses the Canadian border with zero resistance. The flip side: long summer days (15+ hours of daylight in June), fertile prairie soil, and pests that can't survive your winters.

Your growing season is short but intense. You'll rely heavily on transplants, season extension, and varieties bred for quick maturity.

### Central Plains (Zones 5a–5b)

**States:** Southern South Dakota, northern Nebraska, northern Kansas  
**Last spring frost:** April 25–May 10  
**First fall frost:** October 1–15  
**Frost-free days:** 140–165

The Central Plains give you a workable season with enough time for most standard vegetable varieties. You still deal with brutal wind, late spring surprises (a May snow isn't unusual), and the occasional early fall freeze that catches you off guard. The Sandhills of Nebraska add a unique wrinkle — sandy, well-drained soil that acts completely different from the heavy prairie clay surrounding it.

### Southern Plains (Zones 6a–6b)

**States:** Southern Nebraska, central and southern Kansas, northern Oklahoma  
**Last spring frost:** April 5–20  
**First fall frost:** October 15–November 1  
**Frost-free days:** 175–200

Now we're talking. The Southern Plains offer a legitimate two-season opportunity. You get enough spring warmth to grow full-season tomatoes and peppers, and enough fall length to plant a second round of cool-season crops. This is the heart of the breadbasket, and the soil proves it — deep, dark, and fertile, with the organic matter content that gardeners in other regions spend years trying to build.

Wind is still a constant companion. So are thunderstorms, hail, and the occasional tornado.

### Oklahoma Transition Zone (Zones 6b–7b)

**States:** Central and southern Oklahoma  
**Last spring frost:** March 20–April 5  
**First fall frost:** November 1–15  
**Frost-free days:** 200–230

Southern Oklahoma is where the Great Plains start blending into the South. You get a long growing season, genuine summer heat (100°F+ days are routine in July and August), and enough humidity in the eastern part of the state to change your pest management strategy completely. The Red River valley soil in southern Oklahoma is rich but heavy clay. Western Oklahoma stays drier and more windswept, with soil that trends alkaline.

This zone gives you the best of both worlds — long season AND cool enough winters to grow great brassicas and root vegetables in fall.

## Average First and Last Frost Dates by Region

| Region | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Frost-Free Days |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Northern Plains (4a–4b) | May 10–25 | Sept 15–Oct 1 | 110–135 |
| Central Plains (5a–5b) | April 25–May 10 | Oct 1–15 | 140–165 |
| Southern Plains (6a–6b) | April 5–20 | Oct 15–Nov 1 | 175–200 |
| Oklahoma Transition (6b–7b) | March 20–April 5 | Nov 1–15 | 200–230 |

> **Pro Tip:** Your state's Cooperative Extension Service publishes frost data specific to your county. These are free, hyper-local, and more accurate than any book (including this one) for your exact location. Search "[your county] Extension frost dates."

## The Wind: Your Defining Challenge

Let's talk about the elephant in the room. Except it's not an elephant — it's a 40 mph sustained wind out of the northwest that just shredded your tomato cages.

The Great Plains are the windiest agricultural region in the continental United States. Average wind speeds range from 10–15 mph across most of the region, with gusts commonly exceeding 40–50 mph during spring storms. There's nothing between you and the Arctic but a barbed wire fence, and two of the three strands are broken.

Wind affects your garden in ways you might not expect:

- **Physical damage:** Breaks stems, shreds leaves, topples supports, sandblasts young transplants
- **Desiccation:** Wind strips moisture from leaves and soil faster than still air. A windy 85°F day can stress plants more than a calm 100°F day.
- **Soil erosion:** Exposed soil blows away. The Dust Bowl wasn't ancient history — it was your great-grandparents' lived experience.
- **Wind chill on plants:** Spring wind makes air temperatures feel 10–15°F colder to tender transplants
- **Pollination disruption:** Extreme wind can prevent pollinators from working

Wind management isn't one chapter in this book — it's woven into every chapter. We'll cover windbreaks, sheltered bed design, staking strategies, and variety selection that accounts for your reality.

## Temperature Swings: The Whiplash Factor

The Great Plains hold records for some of the most extreme temperature swings in North American history. Spearfish, South Dakota once recorded a 49°F temperature change in two minutes. That's an extreme example, but 40–50°F swings in a 24-hour period? That's just Tuesday.

These swings create unique challenges:

- **Spring fickleness:** A week of 75°F weather in March doesn't mean winter is over. The Plains can — and will — deliver a hard freeze in April or even May in northern areas.
- **Frost heaving:** Repeated freeze-thaw cycles in spring and fall push shallow-rooted plants right out of the ground.
- **Bolting:** Cool-season crops that experience sudden heat waves bolt to seed weeks ahead of schedule.
- **Blossom drop:** Tomatoes and peppers drop flowers when nighttime temps swing too far from daytime highs.

The key to navigating this is flexibility. Have row covers ready. Don't plant everything at once. Stagger your planting dates. And never, ever put the frost protection away before Memorial Day in the northern half of this region.

## Severe Weather: Hail, Tornadoes, and Derechos

Between April and August, you garden in the heart of Tornado Alley. Let's be practical about this:

- **Hail** is the most common severe-weather threat to gardens. A single hailstorm can destroy a garden in minutes. There's no preventing it, but season extension structures (hoop houses, cold frames) offer some protection, and staggered planting means not everything is at the same vulnerable stage.
- **Tornadoes** will destroy whatever they hit. Your garden is not your priority during a tornado. Get safe. You can replant.
- **Derechos** — straight-line windstorms — can flatten tall crops across wide areas. Sturdy staking and low-growing varieties help.
- **Flash flooding** from intense thunderstorms can drown plants in hours. Raised beds and good drainage are your insurance.

> **Pro Tip:** Keep a stash of transplants or quick-maturing seed varieties on hand during storm season. If hail wipes out your garden in June, you can replant beans, squash, and cucumbers from seed and still get a harvest before frost.

## The Ogallala Aquifer: Water Context

Beneath much of the Great Plains lies the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the world's largest underground water sources. It irrigates about 30% of all U.S. cropland. It's also being depleted faster than it recharges — in some areas of western Kansas, water levels have dropped over 150 feet since the 1950s.

This matters for home gardeners because:

- **Municipal water restrictions** are increasingly common in western Kansas, western Oklahoma, and parts of Nebraska during drought years
- **Well water** from the Ogallala tends to be hard and alkaline, which affects soil pH over time
- **Water consciousness** isn't just environmental virtue — it's practical survival on the Plains

Every watering recommendation in this book assumes you're trying to use water efficiently. We'll cover drip irrigation, mulching, rainwater harvesting, and drought-tolerant variety selection because water is not something you can take for granted here.

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring the wind.** New Plains gardeners plant an exposed garden, watch it get hammered, and assume they can't garden here. You can — you just need wind protection first.
- **Planting too early.** A warm March week does not mean spring has arrived. Wait for your region's safe planting date, or use protection.
- **Treating the Plains like the Midwest.** Iowa and Kansas look similar on a map. They're not. Your wind, your temperature swings, and your soil are different.
- **Not staggering plantings.** One hailstorm shouldn't end your entire season. Plant in waves.
- **Underestimating fall gardening.** The Southern and Oklahoma zones especially offer excellent fall seasons that many gardeners ignore completely.

# Chapter 2: Understanding Prairie Soil

The soil under your feet has a story worth knowing. Much of the Great Plains was tallgrass or mixed-grass prairie for ten thousand years before anyone put a plow to it. That means deep, rich topsoil built by millennia of grass roots dying and decomposing. In some areas of central Kansas and Nebraska, the topsoil is 4–6 feet deep and loaded with organic matter.

That's the good news. The complicated news is that a century of farming, grazing, and development has changed much of that soil. And across a region this large, "prairie soil" means very different things depending on where you dig.

## Soil Types Across the Plains

### Tallgrass Prairie Soils (Eastern KS, Eastern NE, Eastern OK, Eastern SD)

The eastern portions of these states once supported tallgrass prairie — big bluestem, switchgrass, and Indian grass with roots reaching 6–10 feet deep. The resulting soil is dark, deep, and incredibly fertile. These are mollisols — the world's best agricultural soils.

**Typical characteristics:**
- Dark brown to black color
- High organic matter (3–6%)
- Silty clay loam texture
- pH 6.0–7.2
- Excellent water-holding capacity
- Can be heavy and slow to drain

**Working with it:** This soil is a gift. Don't overthink it. Add 1–2 inches of compost annually to maintain structure, and you're gardening on some of the best dirt on the planet. The main challenge is workability — it can be heavy and compacted, especially in new construction areas where topsoil was scraped away. If you're on a newer development, get a soil test immediately. You may be gardening on subsoil, which is a completely different situation.

### Mixed-Grass Prairie Soils (Central KS, Central NE, Central OK, Western SD)

Moving west, rainfall decreases and the tall grasses give way to shorter species. Soils are still good — typically medium-textured loams with moderate organic matter.

**Typical characteristics:**
- Medium brown color
- Moderate organic matter (2–4%)
- Loam to clay loam texture
- pH 6.5–7.5
- Good drainage
- Less water-holding capacity than eastern soils

**Working with it:** These soils are pleasant to work with — not too heavy, not too light. Add compost to boost organic matter, mulch to retain moisture, and you're in business. Watch for alkalinity creeping up in drier years.

### Shortgrass and Arid Soils (Western KS, Western NE, Western OK panhandle)

The western edges of our region are semi-arid. Soils are lighter, drier, and more alkaline. Organic matter is lower because less plant material was available to build it over millennia.

**Typical characteristics:**
- Light brown to tan color
- Low organic matter (1–2%)
- Sandy loam to clay loam
- pH 7.5–8.5
- Low water-holding capacity
- Often high in calcium carbonate

**Working with it:** Build organic matter aggressively. Compost, composted manure, cover crops — anything you can add. Consider raised beds filled with amended soil if your native ground is especially poor. The alkaline pH can lock up iron, manganese, and zinc, causing deficiency symptoms even when those nutrients are present. Sulfur amendments and acidifying fertilizers help.

### Red Bed Soils (Central and Western Oklahoma)

Much of Oklahoma — especially the central corridor — sits on reddish-brown clay soils derived from ancient red shale and sandstone. These "red beds" are the reason Oklahoma's rivers run red after a rain.

**Typical characteristics:**
- Distinctive red-brown color
- Moderate fertility
- Clay to clay loam texture
- pH 6.5–7.8
- Sticky when wet, hard when dry
- Often shallow with rock layers beneath

**Working with it:** Similar approach to any heavy clay — compost, gypsum, and patience. Raised beds solve most problems. The red color is iron oxide, which is actually a good sign for mineral content. Don't let the color worry you.

### Nebraska Sandhills

The Sandhills region of central Nebraska is unique — 19,000 square miles of grass-covered sand dunes sitting directly on the Ogallala Aquifer. If you garden here, you're working with deep sand that drains almost instantly.

**Typical characteristics:**
- Light-colored sandy soil
- Very low organic matter (<1%)
- Rapid drainage
- Near-neutral pH (6.5–7.0)
- Very low nutrient-holding capacity

**Working with it:** Sand needs everything clay has too much of — organic matter, water retention, and nutrients. Build raised beds with imported soil, or amend heavily with compost and bentonite clay. Mulch is absolutely critical. You'll water more frequently but in shorter durations.

## Get a Soil Test

I'm going to say this once, and I mean it: **get a soil test before you do anything else.** A $15–25 soil test from your state's Extension service lab will tell you your pH, nutrient levels, and organic matter content. It eliminates guessing.

**State soil testing labs:**

| State | Lab | Cost |
|-------|-----|------|
| Kansas | K-State Soil Testing Lab | ~$15–20 |
| Nebraska | Ward Lab or UNL Soil & Plant Analytical Lab | ~$15–25 |
| Oklahoma | OSU Soil, Water & Forage Analytical Lab | ~$10–15 |
| North Dakota | NDSU Soil Testing Lab | ~$15–20 |
| South Dakota | SDSU Soil Testing Lab | ~$15–20 |

Take samples from multiple spots in your garden area, mix them together, and send in one combined sample. Test every 2–3 years.

## Amending Prairie Soil

For most Plains gardeners, the amendment plan is straightforward:

**Compost:** The universal amendment. Add 2–4 inches annually, worked into the top 6–8 inches. It improves clay drainage, sandy water retention, and everything in between. Make your own or buy in bulk — bagged compost from the hardware store gets expensive fast for garden-scale use.

**Gypsum (calcium sulfate):** Specifically for heavy clay soils. Gypsum helps break up clay structure without changing pH. Apply 40 lbs per 1,000 square feet and work in. You'll see improvement over one to two seasons.

**Sulfur:** For alkaline soils (pH above 7.5). Elemental sulfur lowers pH gradually. Follow soil test recommendations — it's easy to overdo. Typically 1–2 lbs per 100 square feet to drop pH by half a point. Takes several months to work.

**Composted manure:** Excellent for building organic matter. Cattle manure is everywhere on the Plains and usually free for the hauling. Make sure it's aged or composted at least 6 months — fresh manure will burn plants and may contain weed seeds. Avoid manure from animals fed hay treated with aminopyralid or similar persistent herbicides. This is a real and serious problem on the Plains. If you can't verify the hay source, skip it.

> **Pro Tip:** Aminopyralid-contaminated manure is the silent garden killer of the Great Plains. This herbicide survives digestion, composting, and even soil breakdown for years. It causes curled, cupped leaves and stunted growth in tomatoes, beans, and other broadleaf crops. Before using any manure, do a bioassay: plant a few bean seeds in a pot of the manure mixed with potting soil. If the beans grow normally, you're safe. If they curl and die, that manure is poison to your garden.

**Cover crops:** The Plains gardener's best friend. Plant a mix of winter rye, crimson clover, or hairy vetch in fall after your garden is done. These hold soil against wind erosion (critical here), add organic matter when turned under in spring, and improve soil structure over time. We'll cover this in detail in Chapter 20.

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the soil test.** You wouldn't take medicine without a diagnosis. Don't amend soil without data.
- **Assuming prairie soil is always great.** If your house was built in the last 30 years, the topsoil may have been scraped away during construction. What's left might be subsoil or fill dirt.
- **Using contaminated manure.** Aminopyralid damage looks like herbicide drift and can persist for 2–3 years. Always bioassay first.
- **Working clay soil when wet.** Tilling or digging wet clay creates rock-hard clumps that take years to break down. Wait until it crumbles when squeezed — not sticks.
- **Ignoring wind erosion.** Bare soil + Great Plains wind = soil loss. Keep beds covered with mulch, cover crops, or growing plants at all times.

# Chapter 3: Water-Smart Gardening on the Plains

Water is the thing you never have enough of when you need it, and too much of when you don't. That's the Great Plains in a sentence.

Annual rainfall ranges from 15 inches in the western panhandles to 45+ inches in eastern Oklahoma — a three-fold difference across the region this book covers. Drought is a regular visitor everywhere, and even in wetter years, rainfall distribution is uneven: heavy spring thunderstorms dump inches in hours, followed by weeks of nothing in July and August.

Layer in the Ogallala Aquifer situation — a declining water table that supports agriculture across much of western Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — and water-smart gardening isn't a lifestyle choice on the Plains. It's how you keep gardening.

## How Much Water Do Vegetables Need?

Most vegetables need about 1–1.5 inches of water per week during active growth. On the Plains, wind and heat can push that to 2 inches during peak summer. Here's the thing: it matters more *how* you deliver that water than *how much*.

**Deep, infrequent watering beats shallow, frequent watering.** Watering deeply (soaking the soil 6–8 inches down) two to three times per week encourages deep root growth. Roots that go deep find moisture even when the surface is dry. Shallow daily watering keeps roots near the surface where they're vulnerable to heat, wind, and drought.

## Drip Irrigation: The Plains Standard

If you take one piece of equipment advice from this book, let it be this: **install drip irrigation.** On the wind-blasted, sun-baked Great Plains, drip is not a luxury — it's the most practical way to keep a garden alive.

**Why drip beats everything else here:**
- **Wind doesn't affect it.** Sprinklers on a 20 mph day (which is most days) lose 30–50% of water to evaporation and drift. Drip puts water at the root zone.
- **Less disease.** Dry foliage means fewer fungal problems.
- **Water efficiency.** Drip uses 30–50% less water than overhead watering.
- **Weed reduction.** Only the plant row gets wet, not the pathways.

**Basic drip setup:** A timer at the faucet, a pressure regulator, a filter, mainline tubing (½ inch), and drip tape or emitter tubing (⅝ inch with emitters every 12 inches) running along your rows. Total cost for a 4-bed garden: $80–150. You'll save that in water bills the first summer.

**Scheduling:** Run drip for 45–60 minutes per session, 2–3 times per week during peak summer. Adjust based on rainfall and soil type. Clay soil needs less frequent but longer runs. Sandy soil needs more frequent, shorter runs.

## Mulch: Your Second Irrigation System

Mulch is free water. A 3–4 inch layer of organic mulch (straw, wood chips, shredded leaves) on your garden beds reduces water evaporation by 25–50%. On the Plains, where wind accelerates evaporation beyond what temperature alone would cause, mulch is non-negotiable.

**Best mulch materials for Plains gardens:**

- **Straw:** Cheap, widely available from agricultural suppliers. Use wheat straw, not hay (hay is full of weed seeds). 2–4 inches thick.
- **Wood chips:** Excellent for pathways and around perennial plants. Free from many municipal programs. Don't till fresh wood chips into soil — they'll tie up nitrogen.
- **Shredded leaves:** If you've got trees, you've got free mulch. Run leaves over with a mower to shred them, then apply 3–4 inches.
- **Grass clippings:** A thin layer (1–2 inches) is fine. Thick layers mat down and get slimy. Make sure the lawn hasn't been treated with herbicide.

> **Pro Tip:** In spring, pull mulch back from beds for a week or two to let soil warm up. Cool soil slows germination and growth. Once plants are established and temperatures are reliably warm, push the mulch back in. This is especially important in the Northern Plains where soil warmth is precious.

## Rainwater Harvesting

Collecting rainwater from your roof is smart everywhere. On the Plains, it's smarter.

A 1,000-square-foot roof area collects about 600 gallons per inch of rainfall. Even in western Kansas (15 inches annually), that's 9,000 gallons a year. In eastern Oklahoma (45 inches), it's 27,000 gallons.

**Basic setup:** Gutters → downspout diverter → food-grade barrel or tank (55-gallon barrels are the starting point, but 250–500 gallon tanks are more practical). A spigot near the bottom connects to a hose or drip system. Elevate the tank on blocks for gravity pressure, or add a small pump.

**Legal note:** As of this writing, rainwater harvesting is legal for residential use in all five states covered by this book. Oklahoma and North Dakota have specific statutes affirming the right. Check current local ordinances, as some municipalities may have restrictions.

## Dealing with Drought

Drought is not a question of *if* on the Great Plains, but *when* and *how bad.* When water restrictions hit or your well runs low, prioritize ruthlessly:

1. **Perennial plants first** (fruit trees, berry bushes, asparagus) — they represent years of investment
2. **Fruiting crops second** (tomatoes, peppers, squash) — they're closest to harvest
3. **Leafy greens and herbs third** — quick to replant when water returns
4. **Let annual flowers go** — they're the first sacrifice

**Drought-tolerant vegetable varieties** are noted in the vegetable profiles in Part III. Okra, cowpeas (black-eyed peas), sweet potatoes, and certain tomato varieties handle drought significantly better than water-hungry crops like celery or lettuce.

## Common Mistakes

- **Watering on a fixed schedule regardless of weather.** If it rained 2 inches, skip your watering. Sounds obvious. People do this anyway.
- **Using sprinklers on windy days.** You're watering your neighbor's yard and the road. Switch to drip or water in the early morning when wind is calmest.
- **Skimping on mulch.** An unmulched garden on the Plains loses moisture twice as fast as one in a sheltered eastern garden. Mulch heavy.
- **Watering shallow and often.** You're training roots to stay at the surface where they'll fry in July. Water deep, less often.
- **Ignoring your soil type.** Clay holds water for days; sand lets it go in hours. Same watering schedule won't work for both.

# Chapter 4: Wind Protection and Garden Design

If Chapter 1 explained why wind is your defining challenge, this chapter tells you what to do about it. No other region in the country needs to think about wind as carefully as the Great Plains. Your garden layout, bed placement, plant selection, and support structures all need to account for the fact that 20 mph is a calm day and 50 mph happens multiple times per season.

## Windbreaks: Your First Investment

Before you plant a single vegetable seed, think about wind protection. A windbreak reduces wind speed for a distance of 10–15 times its height on the leeward side. A 6-foot fence protects an area roughly 60–90 feet downwind.

### Structural Windbreaks (Fast)

- **Solid fences (6 feet):** A privacy fence on the north and west sides of your garden provides immediate wind reduction. Solid barriers create turbulence on the lee side, so place your garden beds at least 6–10 feet away from the fence.
- **50% permeable barriers:** A snow fence, lattice panel, or slat fence that allows about half the wind through actually works *better* than a solid fence for a larger area. It breaks up wind without creating the turbulence problem. These can be built cheaply from pallet wood or purchased snow fence.
- **Buildings:** Your house, garage, or shed is already a windbreak. Place gardens on the south or east side of buildings for both wind protection and reflected warmth.

### Living Windbreaks (Slower but Better)

- **Evergreen hedges:** Eastern red cedar (already everywhere on the Plains), arborvitae, or juniper planted in a row on the north and west sides of your property. They take 3–5 years to become effective but last decades and improve wildlife habitat.
- **Deciduous hedges:** Lilac, Nanking cherry, and American plum grow fast and provide spring flowers and fruit. They lose leaves in winter but are leafed out during the growing season when you need protection most.
- **Annual windbreak crops:** Plant a row of sunflowers, sorghum-sudan grass, or corn on the windward side of your garden. They grow to 6–10 feet in a single season and can be replanted annually while you wait for permanent windbreaks to mature.

> **Pro Tip:** Sunflowers as a windbreak serve triple duty: wind protection, pollinator habitat, and seed harvest. Plant a dense row of tall varieties (Mammoth, Russian Giant) 2 feet apart on the north and west sides of your garden in May.

## Bed Layout for Wind

**Orient raised beds and rows east-to-west.** This minimizes the profile exposed to prevailing north and northwest winds. Plants in north-south rows create a narrow edge for wind to grab; east-west rows present a wider wall of foliage that blocks wind for the plants behind them.

**Use tiered height planting.** Plant tall crops (corn, sunflowers, trellised beans) on the north and west edges of the garden. Medium-height crops (tomatoes, peppers) go in the middle. Low-growing crops (lettuce, root vegetables) get the most sheltered positions on the south and east side.

**Sunken beds:** In the Northern Plains especially, some gardeners dig beds 12–18 inches below grade. This puts plants below the wind line, retains moisture, and provides slightly warmer microclimates. The trade-off is drainage — sunken beds can flood in heavy rain, so they work best in well-drained soils.

## Staking and Supporting in Wind

Standard tomato cages from the hardware store — those flimsy wire cones — will be rolling across your yard by the first June thunderstorm. Plains gardening requires serious support structures.

**Tomato supports that actually work here:**
- **Concrete reinforcing wire cages:** Made from 5-foot-tall concrete mesh (6-inch openings), bent into cylinders 18–24 inches in diameter. Anchor with two T-posts driven 12 inches into the ground. These survive everything short of a tornado.
- **The Florida weave:** String trellising between heavy T-posts every 4 feet. Weave twine on both sides of each plant at 8-inch height intervals as they grow. Flexible enough to absorb wind energy without breaking.
- **Stake and prune:** Single-stake each tomato with a sturdy 6-foot hardwood stake driven 12+ inches into the ground. Prune to 1–2 leaders. Less foliage means less wind resistance.

**General staking guidance:**
- Use materials that flex slightly: bamboo, fiberglass stakes, wooden posts with some give
- Drive stakes deeper than you think necessary — 12 inches minimum, 18 inches for tall structures
- Tie plants loosely. Tight ties plus wind equals snapped stems. Use stretchy fabric ties or old pantyhose (yes, really).
- Check stakes and ties weekly during storm season

## Row Covers and Low Tunnels

Low tunnels — hoops of PVC, EMT conduit, or wire covered in row cover fabric — are the Great Plains gardener's Swiss Army knife. They:

- Block 30–50% of wind
- Add 4–8°F of frost protection
- Extend your season by 2–4 weeks on each end
- Protect against light hail
- Keep flea beetles and cabbage moths off your crops

**Building a basic low tunnel:** Bend 10-foot lengths of ½-inch PVC pipe or EMT conduit into hoops, spacing them every 4 feet along your bed. Cover with medium-weight row cover (1.0–1.5 oz/sq yard) and secure edges with sandbags, bricks, or clips. Total cost: about $25–40 per 12-foot bed.

In the Northern Plains, low tunnels can add three to four weeks to your fall season — the difference between harvesting kale into November or losing it in early October.

## Common Mistakes

- **No wind protection at all.** This is the number-one new gardener mistake on the Plains. Even a temporary barrier helps.
- **Solid barriers too close to beds.** Solid fences create turbulent eddies directly behind them. Give at least 6 feet of space.
- **Using flimsy supports.** If it wouldn't survive a 40 mph gust, it's not strong enough for the Plains. Invest in real stakes and cages.
- **Forgetting to anchor row covers.** An unsecured row cover in a Plains wind becomes a sail. Use heavy anchoring on all sides.
- **Planting tall crops on the south side.** They'll shade everything behind them. Tall crops go north and west; short crops go south and east.

# Part II: Month-by-Month Growing Guide

Each month's chapter gives you specific tasks for each of the four growing regions. Not everything applies to every gardener every year — use your judgment, check your local frost dates, and remember that weather on the Plains follows guidelines, not rules.

# Chapter 5: January — Planning Season

The ground is frozen or close to it everywhere on the Plains. This is your planning month, and good planning now prevents expensive mistakes later.

## All Regions

**Order seeds early.** Popular varieties sell out. If you want specific short-season varieties for the Northern Plains or wind-resistant cultivars, order in January. Recommended seed companies that understand Plains conditions: Gurney's (Greendale, IN — long history with Midwest/Plains gardeners), Jung Seed (Randolph, WI), Seed Savers Exchange (Decorah, IA), and Baker Creek (Mansfield, MO).

**Draw your garden plan.** Map last year's plantings for crop rotation. Sketch this year's layout with wind protection in mind. Note where structures, trees, and fences create sheltered zones.

**Inventory supplies.** Check drip irrigation for damage. Inspect row covers and hoop structures. Order replacement parts now while prices are low and stock is good.

**Review your soil test results.** If you sent soil in last fall, your results are back. Plan amendments accordingly.

## Northern Plains (Zones 4a–4b)

- Browse seed catalogs for short-season varieties (under 70 days for warm-season crops)
- If starting seeds indoors, you don't need to start anything yet. Late February is soon enough for the earliest starts.
- Check cold frames and hoop houses for winter damage. Repair now.

## Central Plains (Zones 5a–5b)

- Same as Northern Plains, with slightly more flexibility on variety maturity days
- Consider starting onion seeds indoors in late January if growing long-day varieties from seed (these need a long head start)

## Southern Plains (Zones 6a–6b)

- Start onion seeds indoors if not already done
- Begin cold-hardy cool-season seeds indoors in late January: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage

## Oklahoma Transition (Zones 6b–7b)

- Start onion seeds indoors now
- Start broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage seeds indoors for February transplanting
- In southern Oklahoma, you can direct-sow spinach and lettuce in cold frames as early as late January

## Common Mistakes

- **Ordering seeds too late.** The best varieties sell out by February. Don't procrastinate.
- **Skipping the garden plan.** "I'll figure it out in spring" leads to overcrowded beds and missed crop rotations.
- **Starting seeds too early indoors.** Leggy, stressed transplants perform worse than properly timed ones. Count backwards from your last frost date, not forwards from your impatience.

# Chapter 6: February — Indoor Starts and Soil Prep

February is when the itch to garden becomes almost unbearable. You can start scratching it — carefully.

## All Regions

**Start seeds indoors.** Use a quality seed starting mix (not garden soil), adequate light (a south-facing window is barely sufficient — a simple LED shop light 2–4 inches above seedlings is much better), and consistent moisture.

**Sharpen and clean tools.** Pruners, hoes, shovels — clean, sharp tools make every job easier and reduce disease transmission.

## Northern Plains

- Start cool-season transplants indoors in late February: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale (8–10 weeks before last frost)
- Start onion seeds indoors if not done in January
- This is NOT the time to start tomatoes or peppers. That's March.

## Central Plains

- Start tomatoes and peppers indoors in late February (8–10 weeks before last frost)
- Start cool-season transplants indoors in early February
- On warm days (above 40°F), turn compost piles

## Southern Plains

- Start tomatoes and peppers indoors in mid-February
- Start eggplant seeds indoors
- Direct-sow peas outdoors in late February if ground is workable
- Plant seed potatoes in late February

## Oklahoma Transition

- Start tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant indoors in early February
- Direct-sow peas, lettuce, spinach, radishes, and carrots outdoors by mid-February
- Plant seed potatoes
- Transplant onion sets and transplants outdoors
- Set out broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and kale transplants by late February with frost protection ready

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting seeds in a dark window.** Seedlings need 14–16 hours of bright light. A window gives you maybe 6 hours of adequate light on a good day. Use supplemental lighting.
- **Overwatering seedlings.** Damping off (a fungal disease that kills seedlings at the soil line) is caused by too much moisture and poor air circulation. Let the surface dry slightly between waterings.
- **Hardening off improperly.** Seedlings grown indoors need 7–10 days of gradual outdoor exposure before transplanting. Skip this step and they'll sunburn, windburn, or just keel over.

# Chapter 7: March — The Tease

March on the Great Plains is a liar. It will give you 75°F days that make you want to plant everything, then follow with a snowstorm. Discipline is your friend this month.

## Northern Plains

March is still winter here. The ground is likely frozen or just beginning to thaw.

- Continue indoor seed starting
- Start tomatoes and peppers indoors in mid-March (6–8 weeks before last frost)
- Start squash and cucumber seeds indoors in late March if using season extension (otherwise wait)
- On warm days, check garden beds and begin cleanup of winter debris

## Central Plains

Spring is stirring but hasn't arrived.

- Start warm-season seeds indoors (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) if not already going
- Direct-sow peas outdoors in mid-March
- Direct-sow lettuce, spinach, radishes, and carrots under row cover by late March
- Plant seed potatoes by mid-March
- Transplant onion sets and transplants outdoors
- Set out cool-season transplants (broccoli, cabbage, kale) by late March with row cover protection

## Southern Plains

Spring is real here, mostly.

- Transplant cool-season crops outdoors if not done in February
- Direct-sow beets, carrots, radishes, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, turnips
- Direct-sow peas (snap, shell, and snow) in early March
- Plant seed potatoes if not done in February
- Start hardening off warm-season transplants late in the month
- Begin preparing beds with compost and amendments
- Keep row covers ready — late freezes are common through mid-April

## Oklahoma Transition

- Plant everything listed for the Southern Plains, plus:
- Transplant tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant outdoors by late March in southern OK with frost protection
- Direct-sow beans in late March in protected spots
- Set up trellises and supports now before the soil is full of roots

> **Pro Tip:** When March gives you a beautiful week, use it for infrastructure, not planting. Build raised beds, install drip irrigation, set up trellises, and prepare soil. This work is easier when the weather's nice and doesn't risk losing plants to the inevitable cold snap that follows.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting warm-season crops outdoors too early.** Soil temperature matters more than air temperature. Tomatoes need soil consistently above 60°F. A soil thermometer costs $10 and prevents heartbreak.
- **Trusting a warm March week.** It means nothing. Check the 10-day forecast, know your frost date, and use protection.
- **Not having row covers ready.** By the time a frost warning is issued, local stores are sold out. Buy row cover in January.

---

# Chapter 8: April — Spring Planting Begins

April is when most Plains gardeners truly get to work. The northern tier is still cautious, but the southern half is in full planting mode.

## Northern Plains

- Direct-sow cool-season crops outdoors in mid to late April: peas, lettuce, spinach, radishes, carrots, beets, turnips
- Transplant onion sets and transplants
- Transplant cool-season brassicas (broccoli, cabbage, kale) under row cover
- Plant seed potatoes
- Continue warm-season indoor starts
- DO NOT plant warm-season crops outdoors. Not yet.

## Central Plains

- Transplant warm-season crops outdoors in late April with frost protection ready: tomatoes, peppers, eggplant (watch weather closely — a late frost can still hit)
- Direct-sow beans, sweet corn in late April if soil temp is above 60°F
- Direct-sow squash, cucumber, and melon seeds in late April under row cover
- Continue successive sowings of lettuce, radishes, and other cool-season crops every 2 weeks
- Set up wind protection structures and staking systems

## Southern Plains

- Full warm-season planting is on: tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash, cucumbers, melons, beans, sweet corn
- Last chance for cool-season crop planting (they'll bolt once daytime highs reach the 80s consistently)
- Plant sweet potato slips in late April
- Direct-sow okra once soil reaches 65°F
- Mulch established beds

## Oklahoma Transition

- All warm-season crops should be in the ground by mid-April
- Plant sweet potato slips
- Direct-sow Southern peas (black-eyed peas, cowpeas) in late April
- Begin mulching heavily
- Start monitoring for pests — aphids, flea beetles, and cucumber beetles emerge now
- Cool-season crops planted in February should be nearing harvest

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting everything on one weekend.** Stagger plantings across 2–3 weeks. This spreads risk (one frost or hailstorm won't kill everything) and extends harvest.
- **Forgetting to harden off transplants.** Even if nighttime temps are above freezing, transplants need gradual exposure to sun, wind, and outdoor temperature swings.
- **Ignoring soil temperature.** Air temp of 70°F doesn't mean soil temp of 70°F. Soil warms slower, especially in clay. Use a soil thermometer.

---

# Chapter 9: May — The Main Event

May is peak planting season across the entire Great Plains. Even the Northern Plains are finally in the game.

## Northern Plains

- Transplant warm-season crops outdoors after last frost (mid to late May): tomatoes, peppers, eggplant
- Direct-sow beans, sweet corn, squash, cucumbers, and melons after last frost
- Continue successive sowings of cool-season crops (these will have a short window before summer heat arrives)
- Plant sweet potato slips in late May
- Direct-sow okra if you're ambitious (choose short-season varieties)
- Install mulch once soil has warmed
- Set up all wind protection and support structures

## Central Plains

- Complete all warm-season planting by mid-May
- Plant sweet potato slips
- Direct-sow okra, Southern peas
- Begin training tomatoes — start pruning suckers if growing indeterminate varieties
- Mulch everything heavily
- Monitor and irrigate as spring rains taper off

## Southern Plains

- Second plantings of squash, beans, and cucumbers for extended harvest
- Monitor early tomato plantings for fruit set
- Side-dress heavy feeders (tomatoes, corn, peppers) with balanced fertilizer or compost
- Watch for squash vine borers — the first generation adults emerge in late May
- Begin harvesting spring-planted peas, lettuce, radishes, and cool-season crops before they bolt

## Oklahoma Transition

- Same as Southern Plains
- Early tomato harvest may begin in southern Oklahoma by late May
- Begin planning fall garden — order seeds for August planting
- Remove spent cool-season crops and compost them
- Hot weather is arriving fast. Make sure irrigation is fully operational

> **Pro Tip:** In the Northern Plains, black plastic mulch on warm-season beds raises soil temperature by 5–10°F, which can be the difference between thriving tomatoes and struggling ones. Lay it 2 weeks before transplanting, and cut planting holes through it. Replace with organic mulch once summer heat peaks.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting Northern Plains gardens too early.** May 15 is a guideline, not a rule. Watch your specific forecast. One night at 28°F kills tender transplants.
- **Forgetting to water transplants.** Even if it rained yesterday, newly transplanted seedlings have tiny root systems. Water them in thoroughly and check daily for the first two weeks.
- **Not mulching.** By mid-May, you should have 3–4 inches of mulch on every bed. It's going to get hot and windy fast.

---

# Chapter 10: June — Growth Explosion

Warm days, long daylight hours, and (usually) adequate spring moisture create explosive growth in June. Your job shifts from planting to maintenance.

## All Regions

- **Water management:** Spring rains often give way to drier conditions. Make sure drip irrigation is working. Monitor soil moisture 2–3 inches down — if it's dry, water deeply.
- **Weeding:** Weeds grow as fast as your vegetables. Stay on top of them while they're small. Mulch suppresses most weeds, but some always get through.
- **Pest patrol:** Walk your garden daily. Early detection is the difference between a minor problem and a crop loss. See Chapter 19 for specific pests.
- **Fertilize:** Side-dress tomatoes, peppers, corn, and squash with compost or balanced fertilizer when fruit begins to set.

## Northern Plains

- Everything is growing. Enjoy it — this intense growth phase is shorter here than anywhere else in this book.
- Successive sow bush beans, lettuce (heat-tolerant varieties), and radishes every 2–3 weeks
- Thin direct-seeded crops (carrots, beets) to proper spacing
- Watch for Colorado potato beetles — hand-pick adults and larvae daily
- Tomatoes should be flowering by late June

## Central Plains

- Begin harvesting early crops: lettuce, radishes, peas, broccoli (if it doesn't bolt first)
- Train tomatoes weekly — tie to supports, prune suckers
- Harvest squash and beans as they mature (picking keeps them producing)
- Plant a second round of bush beans in mid-June

## Southern Plains

- Harvest is in full swing: tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, beans
- Remove spent spring crops — don't let them sit and harbor pests
- As heat intensifies, shade cloth (30–40% shade) can extend pepper and tomato production
- Plant Southern peas and okra — they thrive in heat that wilts everything else

## Oklahoma Transition

- Same as Southern Plains
- Triple-digit days may begin. Water deeply and mulch heavily.
- Begin starting fall transplants indoors in late June: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, tomatoes for fall (yes, start indoor tomato seedlings now for August transplanting)

## Severe Weather Alert

June is the peak of severe thunderstorm and tornado season across the entire Plains. Keep garden tools and loose items secured. Have a replanting plan. If hail strikes:

- Assess damage after 2–3 days, not immediately. Plants often look dead right after hail but recover partially.
- If stems are intact, the plant will likely survive. Remove shredded leaves and let it regrow.
- If stems are broken at the base, pull the plant and replant with a backup transplant or quick-maturing seed.

## Common Mistakes

- **Neglecting water when rain seems adequate.** A 2-inch thunderstorm followed by a week of wind and 90°F heat burns through soil moisture fast. Check moisture levels, not just the rain gauge.
- **Letting squash and cucumbers get too big.** Zucchini should be picked at 6–8 inches, cucumbers at 6–7 inches. Oversized fruit signals the plant to stop producing.
- **Ignoring pest damage.** A few holes in a leaf are no big deal. A colony of aphids on your pepper plants is about to become a disaster. Check daily.

---

# Chapter 11: July — Peak Heat and Maintenance

July is the marathon month. Daytime highs regularly hit the 90s across the entire region — 100°F+ in the Southern Plains and Oklahoma. Your garden is either producing heavily or struggling. Often both at the same time.

## All Regions

- **Water is everything.** Monitor soil moisture daily. Deep water 2–3 times per week in the absence of rain. Early morning watering reduces evaporation.
- **Harvest daily.** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, cucumbers — pick when ripe. Overripe fruit on the vine slows production.
- **Watch for spider mites.** Hot, dry, windy conditions are spider mite heaven. Look for tiny yellow speckles on leaves, fine webbing on undersides. Blast with water early; use insecticidal soap for heavy infestations.
- **Deadhead and remove spent plants.** Finished pea vines, bolted lettuce, done broccoli — pull them, compost them, and free up space for fall plantings.

## Northern Plains

- Peak of the growing season. Everything is producing or about to.
- Successive sow quick crops: bush beans, lettuce (heat-tolerant 'Jericho', 'Muir'), radishes
- Begin thinking about fall — your window starts closing in August
- Harvest potatoes once vines begin to die back
- Garlic planted last fall is ready when the lower 3–4 leaves have browned

## Central Plains

- Heat stress may slow tomato fruit set — this is normal. Plants will resume setting fruit when nighttime temps drop back below 75°F.
- Harvest onions when tops fall over
- Continue harvesting everything aggressively
- In late July, start fall transplants indoors: broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale

## Southern Plains

- Tomatoes may stop setting fruit. Keep plants alive and watered — they'll rebound in September.
- Okra, cowpeas, and sweet potatoes are loving this heat
- Remove exhausted spring plants
- Start fall tomato and pepper transplants indoors in late July

## Oklahoma Transition

- Triple-digit days are common. Shade cloth over tomatoes and peppers.
- Same as Southern Plains — okra, cowpeas, and sweet potatoes dominate
- Start fall transplants indoors: tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage
- Southern Oklahoma gardeners can plan for a full fall garden beginning in August

## Common Mistakes

- **Giving up when tomatoes stop setting fruit.** They're not dead — they're waiting for cooler nights. Keep watering.
- **Under-watering.** In July heat and wind, a garden can need 2+ inches of water per week. Most people provide half that.
- **Not starting fall seedlings.** If you wait until September to think about fall, you've missed it. Start transplants indoors in July.

---

# Chapter 12: August — Fall Garden Starts Now

August is two gardens at once: maintaining the summer garden while launching the fall one. It's the busiest month of the year for serious Plains gardeners.

## All Regions

- **Fall is not a separate thing — it's the continuation.** The most productive Plains gardens treat this as one continuous growing year, not two disconnected seasons.

## Northern Plains

- Direct-sow cool-season crops for fall harvest in early August: lettuce, spinach, radishes, turnips, kale, peas (for fall harvest)
- Transplant broccoli and cabbage starts outdoors by mid-August
- This is your last chance for fall planting — the window closes fast
- Continue harvesting summer crops
- Begin pulling spent summer plants as they finish

## Central Plains

- Direct-sow cool-season crops: lettuce, spinach, radishes, beets, carrots, turnips, kale
- Transplant fall brassicas outdoors in mid-August
- Plant a second round of bush beans in early August (60-day varieties will mature before frost)
- Sweet potatoes continue growing — don't harvest yet
- Reduce fertilizer on tomatoes and peppers to encourage ripening of existing fruit rather than new growth

## Southern Plains

- Full fall planting mode: direct-sow all cool-season crops
- Transplant fall tomatoes and peppers outdoors by late August
- Direct-sow bush beans, squash, and cucumbers for fall harvest
- Transplant fall brassicas
- New plantings need protection from heat: shade cloth for the first two weeks, consistent water, mulch

## Oklahoma Transition

- Same as Southern Plains — treat August like a second spring
- Transplant fall tomatoes and peppers outdoors
- Direct-sow everything the Southern Plains is sowing
- Fall-planted warm-season crops in Oklahoma will produce from October through first frost — often into November
- Start onion seeds indoors for fall transplanting (these will overwinter and produce spring bulbs)

> **Pro Tip:** Starting fall transplants in the heat is tricky. Seed starting in an air-conditioned space (even a garage with a portable AC) and supplemental lighting works far better than a sweltering greenhouse. Seedlings don't like 100°F any more than you do.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting too long for fall planting.** Count backwards from your first frost date. If broccoli needs 85 days to mature, and your first frost is October 15, you needed it in the ground by late July.
- **Not watering fall transplants enough.** August heat dries out small transplants in hours. Water twice daily until they establish — morning and late afternoon.
- **Forgetting that fall crops often taste better.** Cool-weather maturation makes brassicas sweeter and lettuce less bitter. Fall gardening is worth the effort.

---

# Chapter 13: September — The Fall Reward

September is harvest month across the Plains. Summer crops are finishing strong, fall crops are establishing, and the weather is finally cooperating instead of fighting you.

## Northern Plains

- Harvest everything that's mature. Frost can arrive as early as mid-September.
- Green tomatoes should be picked before first frost — ripen indoors or make green tomato relish
- Cover tender crops with row cover on frost-warning nights. First frosts are often followed by 2–3 more weeks of decent weather (Indian summer).
- Fall cool-season crops planted in August are growing vigorously
- Dig sweet potatoes before first frost (even a light frost damages tubers)
- Plant garlic cloves in late September for next year's harvest

## Central Plains

- Summer crops still producing: tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans
- Fall cool-season crops hitting stride: lettuce, spinach, radishes, kale
- Harvest winter squash when the rind is hard and can't be dented with a fingernail
- Plant garlic in late September to early October
- Seed cover crops in empty beds

## Southern Plains

- Fall tomatoes and peppers beginning to set fruit
- Cool-season crops growing fast in the moderating heat
- Direct-sow another round of lettuce, spinach, and radishes for late fall harvest
- Harvest sweet potatoes before first frost (typically mid to late October here)
- Plant garlic in October

## Oklahoma Transition

- Fall garden is hitting full stride
- Fall tomatoes and peppers are producing
- Direct-sow cool-season crops for December harvest
- Harvest summer sweet potatoes
- Begin planting overwintering crops: spinach, kale, and garlic (October)

## Common Mistakes

- **Not protecting crops from early frost.** A simple row cover over your tomatoes can give you 2–4 more weeks of harvest. That's dozens of pounds of tomatoes.
- **Letting sweet potatoes freeze.** Even a light frost damages sweet potato tubers. Harvest before the first frost date.
- **Not planting garlic.** Fall is the only time to plant garlic on the Plains. If you miss September/October, you miss the whole year. (See the garlic profile in Chapter 17.)

---

# Chapter 14: October — Cool Season Peak and Closing

October is the great divide. Northern gardeners are closing down; southern gardeners are hitting their fall stride.

## Northern Plains

- Hard frost has likely hit. Tender crops are done.
- Harvest remaining root crops: carrots, beets, turnips, parsnips (parsnips are actually sweeter after frost)
- Kale and spinach under row cover or in cold frames can keep producing through October and sometimes into November
- Clean up garden beds — remove dead plants, compost healthy material, discard diseased material
- Spread compost or composted manure on beds
- Plant garlic if not done in September
- Seed cover crops (winter rye is the most reliable choice for the Northern Plains)
- Put the garden to bed for winter — mulch beds with 4–6 inches of straw or shredded leaves

## Central Plains

- First frost typically arrives mid-October
- Harvest and protect as described for the Northern Plains
- Fall broccoli and cauliflower should be ready
- Continue harvesting kale, spinach, lettuce under row cover
- Plant garlic by mid-October
- Seed cover crops in empty beds
- Begin garden cleanup

## Southern Plains

- First frost typically arrives late October to early November
- Fall crops are producing heavily: broccoli, cauliflower, kale, lettuce, spinach, root vegetables
- Fall tomatoes and peppers continue until frost
- Plant garlic
- Seed cover crops in empty beds
- Begin winterization of beds that are done for the year

## Oklahoma Transition

- No frost yet in most years. The garden is still going strong.
- Full harvest of fall crops
- Direct-sow spinach and lettuce for December/January harvest under row cover
- Plant garlic and onion sets for spring
- Fall tomatoes still producing

## Common Mistakes

- **Not harvesting before hard frost.** A hard freeze (below 28°F for 4+ hours) kills most crops. Monitor your forecast and harvest anything vulnerable before it hits.
- **Leaving bare soil over winter.** Cover crops or mulch. Bare soil erodes in winter wind and loses nutrients.
- **Skipping fall soil amendment.** Compost applied now has all winter to integrate. Spring compost doesn't have that luxury.

---

# Chapter 15: November — Closing Down and Looking Ahead

November brings the season to a close for most of the Plains, with the Oklahoma Transition zone as the notable exception.

## Northern Plains

- The garden is done. If you haven't completed cleanup and winterization, do it now before the ground freezes solid.
- Review the season: What worked? What failed? What will you change? Write it down — you will not remember in January.
- Order seed catalogs (if anyone still does this — or bookmark online catalogs)
- Maintain and store tools. Clean, oil, and sharpen everything. Store hoses indoors to prevent freeze damage.

## Central Plains

- Garden is mostly done. Kale and spinach in cold frames may still be producing.
- Complete cleanup and winterization
- Drain and store irrigation systems if you're in an area where lines will freeze

## Southern Plains

- First frost has likely hit. Tender crops are done.
- Hardy crops (kale, spinach, collards, Brussels sprouts) continue under row cover
- Complete fall garlic planting if not done
- Winter garden planning begins

## Oklahoma Transition

- First frost typically arrives in early to mid-November
- Protect fall crops with row covers to extend harvest
- Hardy greens (kale, spinach, collards) will produce through most of winter in southern Oklahoma with minimal protection
- Harvest any remaining warm-season crops before frost
- This is an excellent time to build or repair raised beds, install permanent windbreaks, or improve infrastructure

## Common Mistakes

- **Not reviewing the season.** Gardening is iterative. Notes from this year make next year better. Keep a simple garden journal — even a few sentences per month.
- **Leaving irrigation in place to freeze.** Frozen drip lines crack. Drain them and store indoors, or at minimum drain all water and leave ends open.

---

# Chapter 16: December — Rest and Plan

December is for resting, reading seed catalogs, and dreaming about next year. Your soil is building organic matter under that cover crop or mulch blanket. Let it work.

## All Regions

- **Rest.** You earned it. The Plains ask a lot of their gardeners.
- Browse seed catalogs and plan next year's garden
- Order seeds in late December for the best selection
- Gift yourself gardening tools, books, or supplies
- Check on cold frames and overwintering crops (Southern Plains and Oklahoma Transition only)

## Oklahoma Transition

- Hardy greens under protection are still producing in many years
- Check cold frames and row covers after ice storms
- Direct-sow spinach in cold frames for late winter harvest

## Common Mistakes

- **Neglecting overwintering crops.** If you have kale or spinach under row cover, check them after storms. Remove snow loads that could collapse supports, and vent on warm days to prevent overheating.
- **Not resting.** Burnout is real. Take December off. The dirt will be there in January.

# Part III: Vegetable Profiles

These profiles cover 30+ vegetables suited to Great Plains growing conditions. Each includes variety recommendations for our region, planting times by zone, and specific tips for dealing with wind, heat, cold, and the other joys of prairie gardening.

# Chapter 17: Warm-Season Vegetables

## Tomatoes

The king of the vegetable garden, and the crop most likely to break your heart on the Great Plains. Wind, hail, temperature swings, and a host of diseases all conspire against tomatoes here. And yet — with the right approach — you can grow gorgeous, heavy-yielding tomatoes from Oklahoma to North Dakota.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Transplant Outdoors |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late May–early June |
| Central Plains | Late April–mid May |
| Southern Plains | Mid April (spring), Late August (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | Late March–mid April (spring), Late August (fall) |

**Varieties for the Plains:**

- **'Celebrity'** (hybrid, determinate, 70 days): The workhorse. Disease-resistant, wind-tolerant compact habit, heavy producer. If you grow one tomato, grow this.
- **'Early Girl'** (hybrid, indeterminate, 50 days): Essential for the Northern Plains. Gets ripe fast.
- **'Cherokee Purple'** (heirloom, indeterminate, 80 days): Outstanding flavor. Needs wind protection and staking. Worth the effort.
- **'Mountain Merit'** (hybrid, determinate, 75 days): Excellent late blight resistance. Compact, sturdy plant.
- **'Juliet'** (hybrid, indeterminate, 60 days): Grape-type. Extremely productive and crack-resistant. Good in wind because the small fruit handles jostling better than large slicers.
- **'Stupice'** (heirloom, indeterminate, 52 days): Czech variety bred for cool climates. Perfect for the Northern Plains.
- **'Defiant PhR'** (hybrid, determinate, 70 days): Late blight resistant. Compact and sturdy.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- **Wind protection is mandatory.** Use concrete mesh cages anchored with T-posts, or stake-and-weave systems. Flimsy supports will fail.
- **Prune indeterminate varieties** to 2–3 main stems. Less foliage = less wind resistance = less breakage.
- **Mulch heavily** once soil is warm. Tomatoes need consistent moisture.
- **When temperatures exceed 90°F** with nights above 75°F, tomatoes stop setting fruit. This is temporary. Keep watering and the plant will resume when temps moderate.
- **In the Northern Plains,** use black plastic mulch or Wall O' Water to warm soil earlier. Every degree helps.
- **Fall tomatoes** (Southern Plains and Oklahoma) are often better than spring tomatoes — fewer pests, less disease pressure, cooler maturation temperatures.

> **Pro Tip:** Bury tomato transplants deep — up to 2/3 of the stem. Every buried node grows roots, creating a larger root system that anchors the plant against wind and accesses deeper water.

---

## Peppers

Peppers love heat, and the Great Plains have plenty. They're also more wind-tolerant than tomatoes because of their compact, bushy growth habit. Peppers are one of the most rewarding crops for Plains gardeners.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Transplant Outdoors |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late May–early June |
| Central Plains | Early–mid May |
| Southern Plains | Mid–late April (spring), Late August (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | Late March–mid April (spring), Late August (fall) |

**Varieties for the Plains:**

- **'Ace'** (hybrid bell, 60 days): Early, prolific, and compact. Good for the Northern Plains.
- **'King of the North'** (OP bell, 68 days): Name says it all. Sets fruit in cooler conditions than most bell peppers.
- **'Carmen'** (hybrid Italian, 60 days): Sweet, horn-shaped, incredibly productive.
- **'Jalapeño M'** (OP hot, 72 days): Classic. Reliable everywhere on the Plains.
- **'Hungarian Hot Wax'** (OP hot, 60 days): Fast-maturing. Good for the Northern Plains.
- **'Habanero' types** (85–100 days): Only for the Southern Plains and Oklahoma Transition — they need a long, hot season.
- **'Padron'** (OP, 60 days): Small, productive. Pick small for mild, let them mature for heat.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Peppers handle wind better than tomatoes but still benefit from a sheltered spot.
- **Don't over-fertilize with nitrogen.** You'll get huge plants with few peppers. Use a balanced fertilizer, and switch to a low-nitrogen/high-phosphorus option once flowering begins.
- Peppers stop setting fruit above 95°F, similar to tomatoes. They recover quickly when temps moderate.
- **In the Northern Plains,** use black plastic mulch and row cover to warm the microclimate. Peppers planted in warm soil with wind protection will outperform unprotected plants by a wide margin.

## Squash and Zucchini (Summer)

If you can't grow summer squash, you're doing something fundamentally wrong. These are the most forgiving warm-season crops, and they produce so heavily that your neighbors will start locking their car doors in August.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow / Transplant |
|--------|------------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late May–early June |
| Central Plains | Early–mid May |
| Southern Plains | Mid April and again in August |
| Oklahoma Transition | Early April and again in August |

**Varieties:**
- **'Black Beauty'** (zucchini, 50 days): Classic, reliable, unstoppable.
- **'Costata Romanesco'** (zucchini, 55 days): Italian heirloom. Nutty flavor. Ribbed.
- **'Yellow Crookneck'** (summer squash, 50 days): Southern Plains standard.
- **'Patty Pan / Scallop'** (summer squash, 50 days): Compact plants, good for tight spaces.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- **Squash vine borer** is the number-one pest for squash on the Plains. Adults lay eggs at the base of stems in June. Wrap the lower 6 inches of stems with aluminum foil, or use row cover until flowering begins. Inject Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) into stems with a syringe if you find frass (sawdust-like excrement) at the stem base.
- Plant a second round in late June or early July. The first planting often succumbs to vine borers; the second crop matures after peak borer activity.
- **Harvest relentlessly.** A zucchini that's 10 inches long today will be a baseball bat tomorrow.
- Compact bush varieties handle wind better than sprawling vine types.

---

## Winter Squash and Pumpkins

Winter squash needs a long, warm growing season. The Northern Plains can grow them, but variety selection matters.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow / Transplant |
|--------|------------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late May (short-season varieties only) |
| Central Plains | Mid–late May |
| Southern Plains | Early–mid May |
| Oklahoma Transition | Late April–early May |

**Varieties:**
- **'Butternut' (Waltham)** (95 days): The standard. Reliable across the Plains.
- **'Butterbush'** (75 days): Compact bush butternut — perfect for the Northern Plains.
- **'Table Queen / Acorn'** (80 days): Compact vines, manageable size.
- **'Delicata'** (100 days): Outstanding flavor. Works in Central Plains and south.
- **'Lakota'** (85 days): Beautiful, flavorful, and developed from a Native American variety. Good cultural connection to the Plains.
- **'Sugar Pie Pumpkin'** (100 days): Classic pie pumpkin. Works in all but the shortest-season areas.
- **'Jack Be Little'** (miniature pumpkin, 90 days): Fun, productive, and fast enough for the Northern Plains.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- In the Northern Plains, start transplants indoors 3 weeks before last frost. Squash doesn't love transplanting but tolerates it if you minimize root disturbance (use large peat pots).
- Black plastic mulch warms soil and suppresses weeds for sprawling vine crops.
- Cure harvested winter squash in a warm (80°F), dry place for 10 days before storing. Store in a cool (50–55°F), dry location. Properly cured butternut lasts 3–6 months.

## Cucumbers

Cucumbers are fast, productive, and straightforward — with one caveat on the Plains: they hate wind. Those broad, thin leaves dry out and shred easily.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow / Transplant |
|--------|------------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late May–early June |
| Central Plains | Early–mid May |
| Southern Plains | Mid April and late August (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | Early April and late August (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Marketmore 76'** (OP, 58 days): Reliable slicer with good disease resistance.
- **'Diva'** (hybrid, 58 days): Seedless, thin-skinned, incredibly productive.
- **'National Pickling'** (OP, 52 days): The classic pickling cucumber. Fast.
- **'Suyo Long'** (OP, 61 days): Asian type. Handles heat well. Good for the Southern Plains.
- **'H-19 Little Leaf'** (OP, 58 days): Small leaves handle wind better than standard varieties. Good disease resistance.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Grow on a trellis. Vertical cucumbers get better air circulation (less disease), take up less space, and are easier to find in the foliage. A simple A-frame trellis of cattle panel works well.
- **Wind protection is important.** Trellised cucumbers catch wind like a sail. Position trellises parallel to prevailing wind, not perpendicular.
- Cucumber beetles are universal pests on the Plains. They transmit bacterial wilt, which will kill your plants. Row cover until flowering, then hand-pick or use yellow sticky traps.
- Pick cucumbers regularly. Like squash, they stop producing if you let fruit get oversized.

## Beans (Snap, Shell, and Dry)

Beans are the quintessential Plains crop — easy, productive, and genuinely useful. Bush beans are among the most wind-resistant vegetables you can grow. Pole beans need sturdy support.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Late May |
| Central Plains | Early–mid May, again in late June |
| Southern Plains | Mid April, again in early August |
| Oklahoma Transition | Early April, again in August |

**Varieties:**
- **'Provider'** (bush snap, 50 days): Germinates in cool soil better than any other bush bean. Essential for the Northern Plains.
- **'Blue Lake 274'** (bush snap, 54 days): Classic flavor, heavy producer.
- **'Contender'** (bush snap, 49 days): Fast, productive, tolerates cool soil.
- **'Kentucky Wonder'** (pole snap, 65 days): Classic pole bean. Needs very sturdy support on the Plains.
- **'Rattlesnake'** (pole snap, 73 days): Heat-tolerant. Good for the Southern Plains.
- **'Black Turtle'** (dry, 85 days): Compact bush. Good for dried beans.
- **'Pinto'** (dry, 90 days): A Plains staple. Direct-sow in May.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- **Bush beans are more wind-resistant than pole beans.** If wind is severe and you can't provide protection, stick with bush types.
- Inoculate seed with rhizobium bacteria (available at garden centers) for bigger yields. Beans fix their own nitrogen, but only with the right bacteria present.
- Stagger plantings every 2–3 weeks for continuous harvest rather than one overwhelming flush.
- Don't soak beans before planting in heavy clay soil — they'll rot. In sandy soil, a 2-hour soak speeds germination.

## Sweet Corn

There's nothing like fresh sweet corn from the garden. On the Great Plains, where commercial corn is king, growing your own sweet varieties is practically a birthright.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Late May |
| Central Plains | Late April–early May |
| Southern Plains | Mid April |
| Oklahoma Transition | Early April |

**Varieties:**
- **'Bodacious'** (se, 75 days): Outstanding flavor, good disease resistance.
- **'Honey Select'** (se+, 79 days): Sweet, tender, widely adapted.
- **'Peaches and Cream'** (se, 73 days): Bicolor. Reliable.
- **'Luscious'** (se, 75 days): Cold-tolerant. Good for the Northern Plains.
- **'Silver Queen'** (su, 92 days): Classic. For the Southern Plains and Oklahoma only — too long for the north.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows, not single long rows. Corn is wind-pollinated, and block planting ensures good pollination even in variable wind.
- **Wind lodging** (corn blown over) is a real problem. Plant at proper spacing (12 inches apart in rows 30 inches apart), and hill soil around the base of stalks when they're 12 inches tall to support brace roots.
- Corn is a heavy feeder. Side-dress with nitrogen (blood meal, compost, or 10-10-10 fertilizer) when plants are knee-high and again when tassels appear.
- **Raccoons and deer** are your main harvesting competitors. Electric fence works. So does a dog.

---

## Okra

Okra is a Southern crop that thrives wherever summer gets genuinely hot. The Southern Plains and Oklahoma Transition zones are perfect. Central Plains can grow it in a good year. Northern Plains — it's a stretch, but not impossible with season extension.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Early June (with black plastic mulch) |
| Central Plains | Late May |
| Southern Plains | Late April–early May |
| Oklahoma Transition | Mid April |

**Varieties:**
- **'Clemson Spineless'** (55 days): The standard. Widely adapted.
- **'Cajun Delight'** (50 days): Early. Better choice for shorter seasons.
- **'Jambalaya'** (50 days): Compact. Good for wind.
- **'Star of David'** (60 days): Heirloom. Fat, flavorful pods.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Okra is one of the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetables you can grow. It laughs at conditions that wilt everything else.
- Soak seeds overnight before planting — the hard seed coat slows germination.
- Harvest pods at 3–4 inches. Pods left too long become woody and the plant slows production.
- In the Northern Plains, start transplants indoors in peat pots 4 weeks before last frost. Use black plastic mulch and a sheltered spot.

---

## Sweet Potatoes

Sweet potatoes are another heat-loving crop that performs beautifully across the southern two-thirds of the Plains. They're planted from slips (rooted sprouts), not seeds.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Plant Slips |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Late May–early June (short-season varieties) |
| Central Plains | Mid–late May |
| Southern Plains | Late April–mid May |
| Oklahoma Transition | Mid–late April |

**Varieties:**
- **'Beauregard'** (90 days): The standard orange sweet potato. Fast-maturing. Widely adapted.
- **'Covington'** (100 days): Excellent flavor and disease resistance.
- **'Georgia Jet'** (90 days): Fast. Good for the Northern and Central Plains.
- **'Vardaman'** (110 days): Compact bush type. Purple foliage. Beautiful.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Sweet potatoes need warm soil (65°F+). Black plastic mulch is almost essential for the Northern and Central Plains.
- They're drought-tolerant once established — those vines are tougher than they look.
- Harvest before first frost. Even a light frost damages tubers. Cure at 80–85°F and high humidity for 10 days, then store at 55–60°F.
- Vining sweet potatoes serve as a living mulch, covering the ground and suppressing weeds.

## Melons (Watermelon and Cantaloupe)

Melons need heat, consistent moisture, and a long enough season to mature. The southern half of the Plains is ideal; the northern half requires short-season varieties and some tricks.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow / Transplant |
|--------|------------------------|
| Northern Plains | Transplants in early June (short-season varieties) |
| Central Plains | Direct sow late May or transplants mid May |
| Southern Plains | Direct sow late April–early May |
| Oklahoma Transition | Direct sow mid–late April |

**Varieties:**
- **'Sugar Baby'** (watermelon, 75 days): Small (8–10 lb), fast, and sweet. Northern Plains standard.
- **'Crimson Sweet'** (watermelon, 85 days): Classic. Central Plains and south.
- **'Minnesota Midget'** (cantaloupe, 65 days): Tiny, sweet, and fast. Bred for short seasons.
- **'Hale's Best'** (cantaloupe, 80 days): Classic Plains cantaloupe. Reliable.
- **'Ambrosia'** (cantaloupe, 86 days): Exceptional sweetness. Southern Plains and Oklahoma.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Black plastic mulch is the standard for melon culture on the Plains. It warms soil, retains moisture, and suppresses weeds — all critical for melons.
- In the Northern Plains, start transplants indoors 3 weeks before last frost in large peat pots. Melons don't transplant well if roots are disturbed.
- Melons sprawl. Give them space — 4–6 feet between hills.
- Water consistently during fruit development. Inconsistent watering causes split fruit. Reduce water as melons approach maturity for better flavor.
- Cantaloupe is ripe when it "slips" (separates from the vine with gentle pressure). Watermelon: check the belly spot — it should be creamy yellow, not white.

---

## Eggplant

Eggplant is a heat lover that performs well in the Southern Plains and Oklahoma Transition zone. Central Plains can grow it with effort. Northern Plains gardeners should consider it an advanced project.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Transplant Outdoors |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northern Plains | Early June (with protection) |
| Central Plains | Mid–late May |
| Southern Plains | Late April |
| Oklahoma Transition | Mid April |

**Varieties:**
- **'Ichiban'** (hybrid, 58 days): Long, slender, fast. Best choice for shorter seasons.
- **'Black Beauty'** (OP, 80 days): Classic Italian type. Southern Plains and Oklahoma.
- **'Rosa Bianca'** (OP, 75 days): Italian heirloom. Beautiful and mild-flavored.
- **'Hansel'** (hybrid, 55 days): Mini-type. Very fast. Good for the Northern Plains.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Eggplant is the most cold-sensitive of the nightshade family. Don't transplant until nighttime temps are reliably above 55°F.
- Compact varieties handle wind better than large-fruited types.
- Flea beetles love eggplant. Row cover until flowering is the most effective protection.
- Harvest when fruit is glossy and firm. Dull, soft fruit is overripe and seedy.

---

## Southern Peas (Cowpeas, Black-Eyed Peas)

Southern peas are perfectly adapted to the heat and intermittent drought of the Great Plains summer. They fix nitrogen, tolerate poor soil, and produce heavily in conditions that defeat most crops.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Not recommended (too short a season) |
| Central Plains | Late May–early June |
| Southern Plains | May and again in July |
| Oklahoma Transition | Late April and again in July |

**Varieties:**
- **'California Blackeye'** (75 days): Classic black-eyed pea.
- **'Mississippi Silver'** (65 days): Productive and faster-maturing.
- **'Pinkeye Purple Hull'** (65 days): Outstanding flavor.
- **'Iron Clay'** (85 days): Excellent as a cover crop/dual-purpose crop.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Cowpeas handle heat, drought, and poor soil better than almost any other garden vegetable. They're the ultimate Plains survivor crop.
- Don't fertilize with nitrogen — they make their own.
- Harvest for fresh shell peas when pods are plump but still green. For dry peas, leave pods on the vine until they rattle.
- Double-duty: cowpeas planted in empty garden beds improve soil while producing food.

# Chapter 18: Cool-Season Vegetables

## Lettuce and Salad Greens

Lettuce is the gateway crop for new gardeners and a staple for experienced ones. On the Plains, timing is everything — lettuce bolts fast in heat but thrives in the bookend seasons.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | April–May (spring), August (fall) |
| Central Plains | March–April (spring), August–September (fall) |
| Southern Plains | March (spring), September–October (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February–March (spring), September–November (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Jericho'** (romaine, 60 days): Heat-tolerant. Best bolt resistance of any romaine.
- **'Muir'** (butterhead, 55 days): Heat-tolerant. Sweet.
- **'Red Sails'** (loose-leaf, 45 days): Fast, beautiful, bolt-resistant.
- **'Winter Density'** (romaine/butterhead cross, 58 days): Cold-hardy. Excellent for fall.
- **'Salanova' types** (various, 50–55 days): Cut-and-come-again. Incredibly productive.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- **Bolt prevention:** Shade cloth (30–40%) extends spring lettuce by 2–3 weeks. Mulch keeps roots cool.
- In fall, lettuce is far easier to grow on the Plains than in spring. Cooling temperatures = slow bolting = better flavor.
- Direct-sow every 2 weeks for continuous harvest.
- Cut-and-come-again harvesting (cutting outer leaves, leaving the center to regrow) extends harvest from a single planting.
- Under row cover in a cold frame, lettuce can survive into December in the Central Plains and later in the Southern zones.

## Spinach

True spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a cold-weather champion that bolts at the first hint of warm weather. On the Plains, that gives you two windows: early spring and fall.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | April (spring), late August (fall) |
| Central Plains | March (spring), September (fall) |
| Southern Plains | February–March (spring), September–October (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), October–November (fall, can overwinter) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Bloomsdale Long Standing'** (OP, 48 days): Classic savoy type. Better bolt resistance than most.
- **'Space'** (hybrid, 40 days): Smooth-leaf. Fast. Easy to wash.
- **'Corvair'** (hybrid, 45 days): Semi-savoy. Good for baby leaf.
- **'Giant Winter'** (OP, 45 days): Hardy overwintering type for the Southern Plains and Oklahoma.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Spinach germinates best in cool soil (40–65°F). Hot soil prevents germination — don't bother planting in summer.
- Fall spinach sown in September/October in the Southern Plains and Oklahoma can overwinter under row cover and produce a massive spring harvest before bolting.
- Spinach is a heavy nitrogen feeder. Amend with compost or blood meal before planting.
- For a spinach-like crop in summer, grow **New Zealand spinach** (Tetragonia) or **Malabar spinach** — heat-lovers that fill the gap when true spinach bolts.

---

## Kale

Kale is the toughest green in the garden. It handles cold that would kill lettuce, tolerates more heat than spinach, and actually tastes better after frost. It's the ultimate Great Plains green.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow / Transplant |
|--------|------------------------|
| Northern Plains | April–May (spring), July–August (fall) |
| Central Plains | March–April (spring), August (fall) |
| Southern Plains | March (spring), September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February–March (spring), September–October (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Winterbor'** (hybrid, 60 days): The cold-hardiest kale. Survives single-digit temps. Curly type.
- **'Red Russian'** (OP, 50 days): Flat leaves, tender texture. Beautiful purple-red color intensifies with cold.
- **'Lacinato / Dinosaur'** (OP, 60 days): Dark green, strap-shaped leaves. Outstanding flavor.
- **'White Russian'** (hybrid, 50 days): Like Red Russian but hardier.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Kale can survive temperatures into the single digits (°F) and even below 0°F with row cover protection. In the Southern Plains and Oklahoma, it often survives the entire winter.
- Frost sweetens kale by converting starches to sugars. Fall-grown kale is almost always better than spring-grown.
- Harvest outer leaves, leaving the growing center. A single kale plant can produce for 6+ months.
- Aphids love kale in fall. Blast them off with water. Ladybugs and parasitic wasps are your allies.
- In the Northern Plains, kale under a cold frame is your latest-producing crop, often harvesting through Thanksgiving and beyond.

## Broccoli

Broccoli is cool-season royalty — finicky about temperature, rewarding when you get it right. The Plains' temperature swings make broccoli a timing challenge, but fall broccoli is consistently excellent.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Transplant Outdoors |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late April (spring), mid-August (fall) |
| Central Plains | Late March (spring), early August (fall) |
| Southern Plains | March (spring), late August–September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), September (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Waltham 29'** (OP, 74 days): Excellent side-shoot production after main head is harvested.
- **'Green Magic'** (hybrid, 60 days): Fast, uniform heads. Heat-tolerant for broccoli.
- **'Belstar'** (hybrid, 66 days): Widely adapted. Excellent stress tolerance.
- **'De Cicco'** (OP, 65 days): Italian heirloom. Main head is small but produces side shoots for weeks.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- **Fall broccoli is almost always better than spring broccoli on the Plains.** Spring temperature spikes cause buttoning (tiny, premature heads) and bolting. Fall's gradually cooling temps produce large, tight heads.
- Start transplants indoors — broccoli doesn't direct-sow well.
- Cabbage worms (the green caterpillars from white butterflies) are guaranteed. Bt spray or row cover are your options.
- After cutting the main head, leave the plant. Most varieties produce side shoots for weeks.

---

## Cauliflower

Cauliflower is broccoli's fussier cousin. It demands consistent cool temperatures and throws tantrums (bolting, buttoning, ricey curds) when stressed. That said, fall cauliflower on the Plains can be spectacular.

**Planting times:** Same as broccoli.

**Varieties:**
- **'Snow Crown'** (hybrid, 50 days): Most reliable variety for the Plains. Fast and forgiving.
- **'Amazing'** (hybrid, 68 days): Heat-tolerant. Good for challenging spring weather.
- **'Graffiti'** (hybrid, 80 days): Purple. Doesn't need blanching. Eye-catching.
- **'Cheddar'** (hybrid, 68 days): Orange. Nutty flavor. High in beta-carotene.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Blanch white varieties by folding leaves over the developing head and securing with a clothespin or rubber band. This keeps curds white and prevents bitterness. Purple and orange varieties skip this step.
- Even more than broccoli, cauliflower benefits from consistent moisture and cool temperatures. Mulch heavily, water consistently.
- If spring cauliflower buttons (forms tiny premature heads), pull the plants and move on. Don't wait for them to size up — they won't.

---

## Cabbage

Cabbage is one of the most reliable cool-season crops on the Plains. It tolerates cold, handles some heat, and stores well for winter.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Transplant Outdoors |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late April (spring), mid-August (fall) |
| Central Plains | Late March (spring), early August (fall) |
| Southern Plains | March (spring), September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), September–October (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Copenhagen Market'** (OP, 72 days): Classic green. Medium heads, excellent flavor.
- **'Golden Acre'** (OP, 65 days): Early, compact heads. Good for the Northern Plains.
- **'Red Acre'** (OP, 76 days): Red cabbage. Beautiful and nutritious.
- **'Storage No. 4'** (OP, 95 days): Bred for long storage. Keeps 4–6 months in a root cellar.
- **'Gonzales'** (hybrid, 66 days): Mini-cabbage. Perfect for small families.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Cabbage handles wind well thanks to its low, dense growth habit.
- Consistent moisture prevents head splitting. If rain comes after a dry spell, heads may crack — harvest immediately if you see splitting.
- Same cabbage worm prevention as broccoli: Bt or row cover.
- Late-season varieties planted in summer and harvested after frost can be stored in a root cellar or unheated garage for months. This is old-fashioned Plains food preservation that still works.

---

## Peas (Snap, Shell, and Snow)

Peas are one of the first crops you can plant in spring. They thrive in cool weather and produce before most other crops have gotten started.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Mid–late April |
| Central Plains | Late March–early April |
| Southern Plains | Late February–March |
| Oklahoma Transition | February |

**Varieties:**
- **'Sugar Snap'** (snap, 70 days): The original snap pea. Tall vines need support.
- **'Super Sugar Snap'** (snap, 65 days): Improved disease resistance.
- **'Oregon Sugar Pod II'** (snow, 68 days): Flat, edible-pod. Compact.
- **'Green Arrow'** (shell, 70 days): Heavy producer. Good disease resistance.
- **'Tom Thumb'** (shell, 55 days): Dwarf. No support needed. Perfect for the Northern Plains.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Peas can go in the ground as soon as soil is workable — they germinate in soil as cool as 40°F.
- Inoculate with rhizobium bacteria for better yields (same concept as beans but different bacterial strain — use pea/vetch inoculant specifically).
- Tall varieties need sturdy trellising. Use the same cattle panel or heavy-duty approach as other trellised crops. Wind will test flimsy pea supports.
- Peas are done when temperatures consistently hit 80°F. Harvest what's there and pull the vines. Plant beans in the same spot — they follow nicely in rotation.
- Fall peas are possible in the Southern Plains and Oklahoma (plant August–September), but success is less reliable than spring.

---

## Carrots

Carrots are simple to grow but particular about soil. They need loose, rock-free soil to form straight roots. Heavy clay without amendment won't produce good carrots — but raised beds solve this completely.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Late April–May (spring), July (fall) |
| Central Plains | March–April (spring), July–August (fall) |
| Southern Plains | February–March (spring), August–September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), September–October (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Napoli'** (hybrid, 58 days): Fast. Baby carrot type. Good for the Northern Plains.
- **'Bolero'** (hybrid, 75 days): Excellent storage carrot. Deep orange.
- **'Danvers 126'** (OP, 75 days): Classic. Handles heavier soil better than most.
- **'Scarlet Nantes'** (OP, 68 days): The standard for flavor and texture.
- **'Kuroda'** (OP, 75 days): Stumpy, thick roots. Tolerates heavier soil.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Carrot seed is tiny and slow to germinate (7–21 days). Keep the surface moist during germination — cover with a thin layer of vermiculite or burlap to retain moisture.
- Thin to 2–3 inches apart when tops are 2 inches tall. Crowded carrots produce forked, stunted roots.
- Fall carrots, left in the ground and mulched with 6–8 inches of straw, can be harvested through winter in the Central and Southern Plains. The cold makes them sweeter.
- In heavy clay, grow shorter varieties (Chantenay, Danvers) or use raised beds with loose soil mix.

---

## Beets

Beets are dual-purpose — the roots are sweet and earthy, and the greens are nutritious and delicious. They're fast, cold-tolerant, and easy.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | Late April–May (spring), July (fall) |
| Central Plains | March–April (spring), August (fall) |
| Southern Plains | February–March (spring), September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), September–October (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Detroit Dark Red'** (OP, 55 days): The classic. Reliable everywhere.
- **'Chioggia'** (OP, 55 days): Candy-striped inside. Beautiful.
- **'Golden'** (OP, 55 days): Yellow-orange. Doesn't stain. Milder flavor.
- **'Cylindra'** (OP, 60 days): Cylinder-shaped — slices evenly. Easy to harvest from clay soil.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Beet "seeds" are actually clusters of 2–4 seeds. Thin to 3–4 inches apart regardless of how carefully you space at planting.
- Soak seeds overnight to speed germination.
- Beets tolerate light frost, making them great for early spring and late fall.
- Harvest greens any time. Harvest roots at 2–3 inches diameter for the sweetest flavor.

## Onions

Onions are a pantry staple and a Plains garden essential. The key to growing big bulb onions is understanding day-length requirements.

**Day-length matters:** Onion bulb formation is triggered by day length. The Plains span a critical transition zone:
- **Northern Plains (above 40°N latitude):** Grow **long-day varieties** (14+ hours of daylight trigger bulbing)
- **Southern Plains and Oklahoma (below 37°N):** Grow **intermediate-day varieties** (13–14 hours trigger bulbing)
- **Central area (37–40°N):** Either type works, but intermediate-day is generally more reliable

**Planting times:**
| Region | Plant Sets/Transplants |
|--------|----------------------|
| Northern Plains | April–May |
| Central Plains | March–April |
| Southern Plains | February–March |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (or fall-plant for spring harvest) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Walla Walla'** (long-day, 115 days): Sweet, mild. Northern Plains.
- **'Ailsa Craig'** (long-day, 105 days): Huge, sweet. Exhibition-quality.
- **'Candy'** (intermediate-day, 85 days): Sweet hybrid. Reliable in the Central to Southern Plains.
- **'Red Candy Apple'** (intermediate-day, 85 days): Red, mild, and good for the Southern half.
- **'Yellow Sweet Spanish'** (long-day, 110 days): Classic storage onion.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- **Transplants or sets, not direct-seeded** (unless you start indoors 10–12 weeks early). Sets are easiest. Transplants from a greenhouse produce the biggest bulbs.
- Consistent moisture during bulb formation is critical. Irregular watering causes splitting and small bulbs.
- Stop watering when tops begin to fall over naturally. Let them dry in the bed for a few days, then cure in a warm, dry, ventilated space for 2–3 weeks. Properly cured onions store for months.

## Garlic

Garlic is a fall-planted crop that overwinters in the ground and produces bulbs the following summer. It's the most "set it and forget it" crop in your garden.

**Planting time:** Fall — specifically:
| Region | Plant Cloves |
|--------|-------------|
| Northern Plains | Late September–early October |
| Central Plains | October |
| Southern Plains | October–early November |
| Oklahoma Transition | October–November |

**Types:**
- **Hardneck varieties** (best for Northern and Central Plains): Produce a curly flower stalk (scape) in spring. Larger cloves, stronger flavor, shorter storage life (4–6 months). Varieties: 'Music,' 'German Extra Hardy,' 'Chesnok Red.'
- **Softneck varieties** (best for Southern Plains and Oklahoma): No scape. Smaller cloves, milder flavor, longer storage life (8–12 months). Varieties: 'Inchelium Red,' 'California Early,' 'Silverskin.'

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Plant individual cloves 4 inches deep, 6 inches apart, pointed end up.
- Mulch with 4–6 inches of straw after planting. This insulates against freeze-thaw cycles (critical on the Plains) and suppresses spring weeds.
- Harvest hardneck when the lower 3–4 leaves have browned (typically late June–July). Harvest softneck when tops fall over.
- Cut scapes from hardneck garlic in spring and eat them — they're delicious sautéed and removing them directs energy to bulb growth.
- Garlic from the grocery store is often treated to prevent sprouting and may carry diseases. Buy seed garlic from a reputable source.

## Potatoes

Potatoes are a Plains staple — productive, satisfying, and suited to the climate. They need cool growing weather for tuber formation, which the spring and early summer provide before heat shuts them down.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Plant Seed Potatoes |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northern Plains | Late April–May |
| Central Plains | March–early April |
| Southern Plains | February–March |
| Oklahoma Transition | February |

**Varieties:**
- **'Yukon Gold'** (mid-season, 80 days): The gold standard (pun intended). Creamy, buttery.
- **'Red Norland'** (early, 70 days): Fast. Good for Northern Plains.
- **'Kennebec'** (late, 100 days): Heavy yielding. Excellent baking potato.
- **'All Blue'** (mid-season, 85 days): Purple skin and flesh. Fun and nutritious.
- **'Russet Burbank'** (late, 95 days): Classic. Needs a longer season.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Cut seed potatoes into pieces with 2–3 eyes each. Let cut surfaces dry (callus) for 1–2 days before planting.
- Plant 4 inches deep, 12 inches apart, in trenches or hills. As plants grow, mound soil or straw around stems — exposed tubers turn green and become toxic.
- Colorado potato beetle is your nemesis. Hand-pick adults and larvae, crush orange egg masses on leaf undersides, and rotate potato locations annually. Bt var. tenebrionis works on larvae.
- Harvest "new" potatoes any time after flowering. Main harvest after vines die back completely.
- Cure in a cool, dark place for 1–2 weeks before storage. Store at 40–45°F in the dark.

## Radishes

Radishes are the fastest vegetable in the garden — some varieties mature in 25 days. They're perfect for new gardeners, children, and filling gaps between larger, slower crops.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | April–May (spring), August (fall) |
| Central Plains | March–April (spring), September (fall) |
| Southern Plains | February–March (spring), September–October (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), October–November (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Cherry Belle'** (22 days): Red, round, fast. The classic.
- **'French Breakfast'** (25 days): Oblong, mild, beautiful.
- **'Watermelon / Red Meat'** (60 days): Green outside, pink inside. Stunning. Fall crop.
- **'Daikon'** (60 days): Large white root. Excellent for breaking up clay soil as a cover crop.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Radishes bolt immediately in heat. They're strictly a spring and fall crop.
- Daikon radishes planted as a fall cover crop are called "tillage radishes" — their thick roots break through compacted soil and decompose over winter, leaving channels for water and air. Brilliant for heavy clay Plains soil.
- Sow thinly and thin to 2 inches apart. Crowded radishes produce tops but no roots.

## Turnips and Rutabagas

Turnips and rutabagas are old-fashioned root vegetables that deserve a comeback, especially on the Plains where they thrive in the fall season.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow |
|--------|-----------|
| Northern Plains | May (spring), July (fall) |
| Central Plains | March–April (spring), August (fall) |
| Southern Plains | February (spring), September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), September–October (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Purple Top White Globe'** (turnip, 55 days): The classic. Dual-purpose: greens and roots.
- **'Hakurei'** (turnip, 38 days): Japanese salad turnip. Raw, like a mild, sweet radish. Game-changer.
- **'American Purple Top'** (rutabaga, 90 days): Classic storage rutabaga.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Fall-grown turnips are sweeter than spring-grown (frost converts starch to sugar).
- Turnip greens are as valuable as the roots — harvest outer leaves any time.
- Rutabagas need a longer season than turnips. Plant them earlier (mid-summer for fall harvest).
- Both store well in root cellars or mulched in the ground through winter.

## Swiss Chard

Swiss chard is the indestructible green. It handles more heat than spinach, more cold than lettuce, and just keeps producing for months. It's arguably the most underrated vegetable for Plains gardens.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Direct Sow / Transplant |
|--------|------------------------|
| Northern Plains | May |
| Central Plains | April |
| Southern Plains | March (spring), September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February–March (spring), September (fall) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Fordhook Giant'** (OP, 55 days): Classic white-stemmed. Vigorous.
- **'Bright Lights'** (OP, 55 days): Rainbow stems. Beautiful and productive.
- **'Rhubarb'** (OP, 55 days): Red stems. Deep green leaves.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Chard tolerates light frost (down to about 25°F) and temperatures into the 90s without bolting. This makes it the most versatile green for Plains conditions.
- Harvest outer leaves, leaving the center to regrow. A single planting can produce from May through November in the Central Plains.
- Chard is related to beets — the "seeds" are actually clusters. Thin to 6–8 inches apart.

---

## Collard Greens

Collards are a Southern staple that deserves wider planting on the Plains. They're extremely cold-hardy, heat-tolerant, and nutritious.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Transplant / Direct Sow |
|--------|------------------------|
| Northern Plains | May (spring), late July (fall) |
| Central Plains | April (spring), August (fall) |
| Southern Plains | March (spring), August–September (fall) |
| Oklahoma Transition | February (spring), September (fall, can overwinter) |

**Varieties:**
- **'Georgia Southern'** (OP, 75 days): The classic. Large, blue-green leaves.
- **'Vates'** (OP, 75 days): Compact. More cold-hardy than Georgia.
- **'Champion'** (hybrid, 60 days): Vigorous, bolt-resistant, fast.
- **'Flash'** (hybrid, 55 days): Very fast maturity. Good for short seasons.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Collards survive temperatures into the low teens (°F) without protection, and even colder with row cover.
- In the Oklahoma Transition zone, fall-planted collards often overwinter and produce through spring.
- Harvest lower leaves, leaving the top growth intact.
- Like kale, flavor improves dramatically after frost.

## Brussels Sprouts

Brussels sprouts are the ultimate cool-weather challenge crop. They need a long season of moderate temperatures to produce well — which makes them a fall-only crop on the Plains.

**Planting times:**
| Region | Transplant Outdoors (Fall Crop) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Northern Plains | Mid-June (harvest before hard freeze) |
| Central Plains | Late June–early July |
| Southern Plains | July–August |
| Oklahoma Transition | August |

**Varieties:**
- **'Long Island Improved'** (OP, 100 days): Classic. Reliable.
- **'Jade Cross'** (hybrid, 90 days): Faster. Better for the Northern Plains.
- **'Diablo'** (hybrid, 110 days): Large sprouts. Southern zones only.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Brussels sprouts are planted in summer for fall harvest — they need 90–110 days and maturing temperatures below 75°F.
- Frost dramatically improves flavor. Harvest from the bottom up as sprouts reach 1–1.5 inches.
- "Top" the plants (cut off the growing tip) 3–4 weeks before expected harvest to encourage uniform sprout sizing.
- They're tall and top-heavy — stake them in windy locations.

---

## Asparagus (Perennial)

Asparagus is a long-term investment — it takes 2–3 years to establish but then produces for 15–20 years. The Great Plains climate is well-suited to asparagus because it gets the cold winter dormancy it requires.

**Planting time:** Early spring, as soon as soil is workable.

**Varieties:**
- **'Jersey Giant'** (all-male hybrid): Heavy-producing. Disease-resistant.
- **'Jersey Knight'** (all-male hybrid): Similar performance.
- **'Purple Passion'** (purple, some female plants): Beautiful. Milder flavor.
- **'Mary Washington'** (OP): Classic. Produces male and female plants (females produce fewer, thicker spears).

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Plant crowns in trenches 12 inches deep, 18 inches apart. Cover with 2–3 inches of soil initially, then fill the trench gradually as spears emerge.
- Don't harvest the first two years — let plants establish strong root systems.
- In year 3, harvest spears for 2–3 weeks. By year 4+, harvest for 6–8 weeks.
- Cut the ferny tops to ground level after they brown in fall. Mulch with 4–6 inches of straw.
- Asparagus beds need excellent drainage. Raised beds work well.
- Wind can break tall fern fronds in summer, but this doesn't harm the plant — the roots are what matter.

---

## Rhubarb (Perennial)

Rhubarb is a cold-climate perennial that thrives in the Northern and Central Plains. It needs winter freezing to break dormancy, which most of our region provides in abundance.

**Planting time:** Early spring, from divisions or potted plants.

**Varieties:**
- **'Victoria'** (green stalks with red blush): Most widely adapted. Reliable.
- **'Canada Red'** (deep red stalks): Sweeter. Gorgeous.
- **'Valentine'** (red stalks): Productive and vigorous.

**Plains-specific tips:**
- Rhubarb is marginal in the Oklahoma Transition zone — summers may be too hot. Northern and Central Plains are ideal.
- Don't harvest the first year. Light harvest year 2. Full harvest year 3+.
- Pull (don't cut) stalks from the outside of the plant.
- **Never eat the leaves** — they contain toxic levels of oxalic acid.
- Rhubarb appreciates afternoon shade in the Southern Plains. Full sun is fine in the Northern and Central Plains.
- Divide plants every 5–6 years in early spring to maintain vigor.

# Part IV: Mastering the Details

# Chapter 19: Pest and Disease Management

The Great Plains have a pest and disease profile shaped by our unique conditions: extreme temperature swings knock back some pest populations while favoring others, wind carries certain pests (and their spores) across the wide-open landscape, and the transition from arid west to humid east means your pest pressure varies dramatically depending on which side of the Plains you garden.

## The Big Six: Pests You'll Definitely Meet

### Colorado Potato Beetle

**Targets:** Potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes (occasionally)  
**Identification:** Yellowish-orange beetles with black stripes. Larvae are reddish with black spots. Bright orange egg clusters on leaf undersides.  
**Damage:** Defoliates plants rapidly. A bad infestation can strip a potato plant bare in days.  
**Control:**
- Hand-pick adults, larvae, and crush egg masses daily (tedious but effective)
- Bt var. tenebrionis (trade name: Novodor) on larvae
- Spinosad spray for heavy infestations
- Crop rotation — move potatoes to a new location every year. Beetles overwinter in soil near last year's plants.
- Thick straw mulch slows adult emergence in spring

### Squash Vine Borer

**Targets:** Squash (especially zucchini and winter squash), pumpkins. Cucumbers and melons are less affected.  
**Identification:** Adults are wasp-like moths with red-orange bodies and clear wings. Larvae are white grubs inside vine stems. Look for sawdust-like frass at the base of stems.  
**Damage:** Larvae bore into stems, causing sudden wilting and plant death.  
**Control:**
- Wrap the lower 6 inches of stems with aluminum foil at planting
- Row cover until flowering (remove for pollination)
- Inject Bt into affected stems with a syringe — slit stem lengthwise at the borer entry point, remove larvae, and bury the wounded section
- **Succession planting:** Plant a second round in late June/early July to avoid peak borer activity (mid-June in the Southern Plains)
- Butternut squash is more resistant than other types
- Trap adults with yellow bowl traps placed near plants

### Tomato Hornworm

**Targets:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant  
**Identification:** Huge green caterpillars (up to 4 inches) with white stripes and a horn on the rear end. They're almost invisible against foliage despite their size.  
**Damage:** A single hornworm can defoliate an entire tomato branch overnight.  
**Control:**
- Hand-pick (check plants in early morning or evening when they're more visible)
- Bt spray (Dipel, Thuricide) is very effective
- If you see hornworms covered in white, rice-like cocoons — leave them. Those are parasitic braconid wasp pupae that are killing the hornworm. The wasps are your allies.
- UV flashlight at night makes hornworms fluoresce bright green — surprisingly effective detection method

### Cucumber Beetle (Striped and Spotted)

**Targets:** Cucumbers, squash, melons, beans  
**Identification:** Small beetles — striped (yellow with black stripes) or spotted (yellow with black spots). Very common.  
**Damage:** Adults chew holes in leaves and flowers. More importantly, they transmit **bacterial wilt**, which causes sudden wilting and death of cucumber and melon vines with no recovery.  
**Control:**
- Row cover from planting until flowering
- Yellow sticky traps
- Hand-pick (best in early morning when beetles are sluggish)
- Kaolin clay spray (Surround WP) creates a physical barrier on leaves
- Spinosad spray for heavy infestations
- Remove and destroy any plant showing bacterial wilt symptoms immediately

### Aphids

**Targets:** Everything, but especially brassicas, peppers, and okra  
**Identification:** Tiny, pear-shaped, soft-bodied insects in clusters. Green, black, gray, or pink depending on species.  
**Damage:** Suck plant juices, causing stunted growth and curled leaves. Excrete honeydew that promotes sooty mold. Transmit viruses.  
**Control:**
- Strong water spray — seriously, just blast them off. Repeat every 2–3 days. Most knocked off won't climb back up.
- Ladybugs and lacewings (natural predators). Encourage them by planting flowering herbs and avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides.
- Insecticidal soap or neem oil for heavy infestations
- Reflective mulch (silver-colored) deters aphids from landing

### Grasshoppers

**Targets:** Everything. Grasshoppers eat anything green and are not picky.  
**Identification:** You know what a grasshopper looks like.  
**Damage:** In outbreak years (which happen periodically across the Plains), grasshoppers can consume entire gardens. This is not an exaggeration.  
**Control:**
- Row cover is the most reliable defense for small gardens
- **Nosema locustae** (trade name: Nolo Bait, Semaspore) — a biological control that infects and kills grasshoppers over time. Apply to surrounding areas (yard, field edges) in late spring when nymphs are small. Not a quick kill but reduces populations over the season.
- Guinea fowl are excellent grasshopper predators if you have space for poultry
- Floating row cover over crops during outbreaks
- In bad years, accept some loss. Focus protection on your highest-value crops.

> **Pro Tip:** Grasshopper populations tend to boom after 2–3 dry years and crash after wet years. If your area has been dry for two seasons, prepare for grasshopper pressure the following summer.

## Common Diseases

### Early Blight (Alternaria)

**Affects:** Tomatoes, potatoes  
**Symptoms:** Dark brown spots with concentric rings ("target spots") on lower leaves first, working upward.  
**Management:** Mulch to prevent soil splash onto lower leaves. Remove affected leaves. Copper fungicide spray preventatively in wet seasons. Rotate tomatoes and potatoes annually.

### Powdery Mildew

**Affects:** Squash, cucumbers, melons, peas  
**Symptoms:** White, powdery coating on leaves.  
**Management:** Good air circulation (proper spacing, trellising). Resistant varieties. Potassium bicarbonate spray (1 tablespoon per gallon of water) at first sign. Neem oil.

### Bacterial Wilt

**Affects:** Cucumbers, melons  
**Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of entire vines, no recovery. Cut a stem — if milky sap oozes and stretches between your fingers when pulled apart, it's bacterial wilt.  
**Management:** Control cucumber beetles (they transmit it). Remove and destroy infected plants immediately. No cure once plants are infected.

### Clubroot

**Affects:** Brassicas (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale)  
**Symptoms:** Wilting, stunted growth. Pull plant — roots are swollen and deformed.  
**Management:** Raise soil pH above 7.2 (lime application). Long rotation — 7+ years between brassicas in infected soil. Resistant varieties when available.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Philosophy

The goal isn't a pest-free garden — that doesn't exist. The goal is managing pest damage to acceptable levels while maintaining a healthy ecosystem. On the Plains, your IPM approach should follow this hierarchy:

1. **Prevention:** Crop rotation, resistant varieties, proper spacing, healthy soil
2. **Physical barriers:** Row cover, hand-picking, traps
3. **Biological controls:** Encourage beneficial insects, use Bt and similar targeted biologicals
4. **Targeted sprays:** Insecticidal soap, neem oil, spinosad — as a last resort, targeted to the specific pest
5. **Broad-spectrum pesticides:** Almost never necessary in a home garden. They kill beneficials along with pests and create worse problems long-term.

## Common Mistakes

- **Spraying first, diagnosing second.** Identify the pest before treating. Many "pest" sightings are actually beneficial insects.
- **Killing beneficials.** Ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps, ground beetles, and spiders are your allies. Broad-spectrum sprays kill them all.
- **Not rotating crops.** Many pest and disease problems build up in soil. Moving crop families to new locations each year breaks the cycle.
- **Ignoring early signs.** A few aphids today is thousands of aphids next week. Catch problems early.

# Chapter 20: Companion Planting, Crop Rotation, and Cover Crops

## Crop Rotation Basics

Crop rotation means not planting the same plant family in the same spot in consecutive years. This is simple in concept and transformative in practice.

**Plant families for rotation:**
- **Nightshades (Solanaceae):** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes
- **Cucurbits (Cucurbitaceae):** Squash, cucumbers, melons, pumpkins
- **Brassicas (Brassicaceae):** Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, radishes, turnips
- **Legumes (Fabaceae):** Beans, peas, cowpeas
- **Alliums (Amaryllidaceae):** Onions, garlic, leeks
- **Root crops (various):** Carrots, beets

**The simplest rotation:** Divide your garden into four sections. Rotate: legumes → nightshades → brassicas → cucurbits. Each family follows the one that benefits it most (legumes fix nitrogen that nightshades use heavily; brassicas follow nightshades to break disease cycles).

**Why it matters even more on the Plains:** Colorado potato beetle, squash vine borer, and clubroot all build up in soil where their host crops grow repeatedly. Moving crops even 20 feet can reduce these problems significantly.

## Companion Planting

Companion planting — growing specific plants together for mutual benefit — ranges from well-documented science to garden folklore. Here's what actually works:

**Proven combinations:**
- **Tomatoes + basil:** Basil may deter some tomato pests (disputed), but what's proven is that they use garden space efficiently and taste great together.
- **Corn + beans + squash (Three Sisters):** The original Plains companion planting, developed by Indigenous peoples. Corn provides a trellis for beans, beans fix nitrogen for corn, squash shades the ground (living mulch). This genuinely works and has been proven by millennia of practice.
- **Brassicas + dill/cilantro:** Flowering herbs attract parasitic wasps that prey on cabbage worms.
- **Lettuce in the shade of taller crops:** Use the north side of tomato or pepper plants for heat-sensitive lettuce. Practical and effective.
- **Radishes as trap crops:** Flea beetles prefer radishes over eggplant. Plant a row of sacrificial radishes nearby.

**Skip the myths:**
- "Marigolds repel everything" — Marigolds suppress some root-knot nematodes when grown as a cover crop and turned under. They don't create a magic pest-free zone.
- Complex companion planting charts with dozens of "friends and foes" — most of these are unsupported by research. Keep it simple.

## Cover Crops: The Plains Gardener's Secret Weapon

Cover crops are non-harvested crops grown specifically to benefit the soil. On the Great Plains — where wind erosion is a constant threat and soil health determines everything — cover crops are not optional. They're as important as any vegetable you grow.

**Best cover crops for Plains gardens:**

| Cover Crop | When to Plant | When to Terminate | Benefits |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Winter rye | September–October | Turn under 2–3 weeks before spring planting | Wind erosion control, organic matter, weed suppression |
| Crimson clover | September | Turn under in spring | Nitrogen fixation, organic matter |
| Hairy vetch | September | Turn under in spring | Heavy nitrogen fixation (100+ lbs N/acre) |
| Buckwheat | May–August (quick summer cover) | Turn under at flowering (30 days) | Attracts pollinators, fast organic matter, phosphorus mining |
| Daikon radish | August–September | Dies in winter, decomposes naturally | Breaks up compacted clay, adds organic matter |
| Oats | March–April or September | Winter-kills, decomposes naturally | Quick cover, good nurse crop |

**Plains-specific cover crop advice:**
- **Winter rye is your default.** It establishes fast, survives Plains winters, and holds soil against wind. Seed it as soon as you clear a bed in fall.
- **Don't let cover crops go to seed** unless you want volunteers everywhere.
- **Terminate cover crops 2–3 weeks before planting** to allow decomposition and nitrogen release. Crimping (rolling flat) or mowing followed by shallow incorporation works well.
- In the Northern Plains, winter rye is one of the few cover crops reliable enough to overwinter. In the Southern Plains and Oklahoma, you have more options.

## Common Mistakes

- **No crop rotation in a small garden.** Even in a 4x8 raised bed, you can rotate by quadrant. It's not perfect but it's better than growing tomatoes in the exact same spot for 10 years.
- **Planting cover crops too late.** Winter rye needs 4–6 weeks before hard freeze to establish. Don't wait until November.
- **Not terminating cover crops in time.** A cover crop that's 3 feet tall and flowering in May competes with your vegetables and is hard to turn under. Time it right.

# Chapter 21: Season Extension Techniques

The Great Plains growing season ranges from barely enough (Northern Plains) to generous (Oklahoma Transition). Season extension techniques stretch that window at both ends, turning a good season into a great one and making a short season workable.

## Cold Frames

A cold frame is the simplest season extension tool: a bottomless box with a transparent lid, placed over a garden bed. Sunlight warms the interior; the enclosed space holds that heat.

**Building a basic cold frame:**
- Back wall: 18 inches tall (faces north)
- Front wall: 12 inches tall (faces south)
- Sides: angled from back to front
- Lid: old window, polycarbonate sheet, or rigid clear plastic
- Materials: scrap lumber, straw bales, or even cinder blocks

**How much heat does it add?** A cold frame typically maintains temperatures 10–20°F warmer than outside air. In the Central Plains, this means growing lettuce, spinach, and kale from October through January. In the Northern Plains, it extends your season into November.

**Management tips:**
- **Vent on sunny days** when interior temperature exceeds 75°F. Prop the lid open. Overheating kills plants faster than cold.
- Automated vent openers (solar-powered, no electricity needed, ~$30) are worth every penny. They open and close the lid based on temperature.
- Close the lid by late afternoon to trap heat for the night.
- On extremely cold nights (below 10°F), drape an old blanket or quilt over the cold frame for additional insulation.

## Low Tunnels and Hoop Houses

We covered low tunnels in Chapter 4 for wind protection. They serve double duty as season extenders.

**Low tunnels** (row cover over hoops, 2–3 feet tall) add 4–8°F of frost protection and extend the season by 2–4 weeks. They're temporary and portable.

**High tunnels / hoop houses** (walk-in structures, typically 10–14 feet tall and 12–30 feet wide) are permanent or semi-permanent season extension structures that change the game entirely.

A high tunnel on the Plains can:
- Start the season 4–6 weeks earlier
- Extend fall by 4–6 weeks (or more)
- Grow cool-season crops through winter in the Central and Southern Plains
- Protect crops from hail, wind, and heavy rain
- Maintain higher temperatures for heat-loving crops

**Cost:** A DIY high tunnel (20x48 feet) runs $1,500–3,000 in materials. NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) offers cost-share programs (EQIP) that can cover 50–75% of the cost. Contact your local NRCS office — this program has helped thousands of Plains farmers and gardeners afford high tunnels.

**Wind considerations for high tunnels:** This is critical on the Plains. A high tunnel is a large, wind-catching structure. It must be:
- Anchored with ground posts driven 3–4 feet deep (not shallow ground anchors)
- Oriented with the long axis parallel to prevailing wind (typically north-south on the Plains)
- Covered with greenhouse poly rated for wind (6-mil, 4-year UV-stabilized minimum)
- Equipped with roll-up sides for ventilation — closed sides in a high tunnel on a calm 80°F day hit 120°F inside

> **Pro Tip:** The USDA NRCS high tunnel cost-share is one of the best-kept secrets in Plains gardening. You can get a $5,000–10,000 structure for a fraction of the cost. Applications are accepted year-round at most NRCS offices. Google "NRCS EQIP high tunnel" plus your state.

## Wall O' Water and Season Starters

For individual warm-season transplants (especially tomatoes), teepee-shaped water walls (brand name: Wall O' Water) provide remarkable frost protection — down to 16°F — by surrounding plants with tubes of water that absorb heat during the day and release it at night.

**How to use them:**
- Set up 2–3 weeks before your last frost date
- Fill with water and lean the tops together to form a teepee
- Transplant inside the water wall
- Remove when nighttime temperatures are reliably above 50°F

**On the Plains:** These are most valuable in the Northern and Central Plains, where they can give you a 2–3 week head start on tomatoes, peppers, and other warm-season crops. The water mass also provides wind protection for young transplants.

## Mulch as Season Extension

In the Central and Southern Plains, root crops (carrots, beets, turnips, parsnips) can be left in the ground and covered with 8–12 inches of straw mulch. This insulates them from freeze damage and allows harvest throughout winter by pulling back mulch, digging what you need, and replacing the mulch.

Parsnips are famously better after hard frost — the cold converts starch to sugar. A December parsnip pulled from under snow mulch is one of the sweetest things you'll ever eat from a garden.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not venting cold frames and tunnels.** More plants are killed by overheating in season extension structures than by cold. Vent early and often.
- **Ignoring wind loads on high tunnels.** A high tunnel that's not properly anchored on the Plains becomes a kite. Anchor deeply and orient correctly.
- **Over-investing too soon.** Start with row cover and cold frames. Move to high tunnels after you've proven you'll use the extended season. A $3,000 high tunnel growing weeds is an expensive mistake.

## Soil Temperature Guide for Planting

Soil temperature matters more than air temperature for germination and transplant success. Use a soil thermometer — $10, available at any garden center.

| Crop | Minimum Soil Temp for Planting (°F) | Optimal Soil Temp (°F) |
|------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Peas | 40 | 60–75 |
| Lettuce/Spinach | 35 | 60–65 |
| Carrots/Beets | 40 | 60–65 |
| Potatoes | 45 | 60–70 |
| Beans | 60 | 70–80 |
| Corn | 60 | 65–85 |
| Tomatoes/Peppers | 60 | 70–85 |
| Squash/Cucumbers | 60 | 70–90 |
| Melons | 65 | 75–90 |
| Okra | 65 | 80–90 |
| Sweet potatoes | 65 | 80–85 |

> **Pro Tip:** Check soil temperature at 4 inches deep, in the morning (soil is coolest then). If it meets the minimum at the coolest point of the day, you're safe to plant.

# Acknowledgments

This book exists because of the thousands of gardeners across Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and South Dakota who've been figuring out how to grow food on the Great Plains for generations — from the Indigenous peoples who developed the Three Sisters planting system on these same prairies, to the homesteaders who broke the sod, to the Extension agents, Master Gardeners, and backyard experimenters who keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible in one of the most challenging and rewarding growing environments on the continent.

Special thanks to the Cooperative Extension services of all five states. The research, publications, and personal guidance they provide — mostly for free — is an extraordinary public resource. Use it.

And to you, the reader: you picked up this book because you want to grow food in a place where the wind doesn't stop, the temperature can't make up its mind, and the sky occasionally tries to destroy your garden. That takes a particular kind of stubborn optimism. You'll do great.

Happy growing.
