# Part I: Getting Started in the Pacific Northwest

# Chapter 1: Why the Pacific Northwest Is Different

You live in one of the best places on Earth to grow vegetables. You also live in one of the most misunderstood.

People outside the Pacific Northwest think it rains here all the time. People inside the Pacific Northwest know the truth: it rains here *most* of the time — from October through June — and then it basically stops. That wet-winter, dry-summer split is the single most important thing about gardening in this region, and it shapes every decision you'll make, from when to start seeds to how you water in August.

But here's the thing that makes the PNW genuinely special: you can grow food twelve months a year. Not just hardy greens clinging to life under row cover — actual harvests, real meals, pulled from your garden in January. The mild winters west of the Cascades mean that with a little planning, your garden never has to go dormant. Most of the country can't say that.

That's why this book exists. Not to give you generic gardening advice with a flannel shirt on it, but to tell you exactly what to plant, when to plant it, and how to keep it alive — based on where you actually live in this wildly varied region.

## The PNW's Five Growing Regions

The Cascade Range splits the Pacific Northwest into two fundamentally different climates, and within each side, elevation and latitude create further variation. Throughout this book, we'll reference five distinct growing regions. Find yours and memorize it — every planting date, variety recommendation, and watering schedule is keyed to these regions.

### Western Washington / Puget Sound (USDA Zones 8a–9a)

**Last spring frost:** March 15–April 15  
**First fall frost:** October 15–November 15

This is the heart of maritime PNW gardening. Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Bellingham — you've got mild temperatures year-round, reliable rain from October through June, and dry summers that surprise newcomers. The growing season is long but cool: you'll get 200+ frost-free days in many areas, but summer highs average only 75–80°F. That means tomatoes need all the help they can get, but lettuce, kale, and peas think they've died and gone to heaven.

Your soil is likely acidic (pH 5.0–6.0), thanks to all that rain leaching calcium and magnesium. Slugs are not a pest here — they're a lifestyle. And the famous "June Gloom" (overcast skies through early July) can delay warm-season crops by weeks compared to national planting calendars.

The upside? Mild winters mean overwintered crops are genuinely productive. You can harvest kale, leeks, Brussels sprouts, and winter lettuce straight through February.

### Western Oregon / Willamette Valley (Zones 8a–9a)

**Last spring frost:** March 10–April 10  
**First fall frost:** October 20–November 15

Portland, Salem, Eugene, and the Willamette Valley share Western Washington's maritime climate but with a bit more summer heat and a slightly longer warm season. The Valley floor is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world — there's a reason Oregon grows most of the nation's hazelnuts, grass seed, and berries.

Your soil situation is generally better than Puget Sound — the Willamette Valley's alluvial soils can be remarkably fertile, though still acidic. Clay is common, especially the infamous Jory and Willakenzie series that turn into either concrete or soup depending on the season.

Southern Oregon (Medford, Ashland) gets notably warmer and drier, bridging the gap between maritime and inland climates. If you're in the Rogue Valley, you'll find tomatoes and peppers much more cooperative than your friends in Portland.

### Eastern Washington (Zones 5b–7b)

**Last spring frost:** April 15–May 15  
**First fall frost:** September 25–October 15

Cross the Cascades and you're in a different world. Spokane, the Tri-Cities, Wenatchee, Yakima — this is high-desert and steppe country with hot summers, cold winters, and 8–15 inches of annual rainfall. If Western Washington is London, Eastern Washington is Denver.

The good news: you get actual summer heat. Tomatoes, peppers, melons, and corn that struggle west of the mountains absolutely thrive here. The Yakima and Wenatchee valleys are commercial fruit powerhouses for a reason — long sunny days, warm nights, and irrigation from snowmelt.

The challenges: shorter frost-free season (120–170 days depending on location), alkaline soils, wind, and the need to irrigate everything. Winter lows can hit -10°F in the coldest spots, making overwintering crops much harder than on the west side.

### Eastern Oregon / Central Oregon (Zones 5a–7a)

**Last spring frost:** May 1–June 1  
**First fall frost:** September 15–October 10

Bend, Redmond, La Grande, Pendleton — Eastern Oregon combines high elevation, extreme temperature swings, and short growing seasons with some of the sunniest weather in the PNW. Bend sits at 3,600 feet and regularly sees frost into June, but it also gets 300 days of sunshine and dry summers perfect for irrigation-based gardening.

The high desert means your soil is volcanic, well-drained (sometimes too well-drained), and often alkaline. Pumice and cinder dominate in Central Oregon. The Pendleton area has better agricultural soil but faces its own challenges with wind and temperature extremes.

Short-season varieties are your best friends here. Choose determinates, early-maturing cultivars, and be ready with frost protection on both ends of the season.

### Northern Idaho (Zones 5b–7a)

**Last spring frost:** April 25–May 20  
**First fall frost:** September 20–October 15

Moscow, Coeur d'Alene, Lewiston, Sandpoint — Northern Idaho shares much of Eastern Washington's climate but with more topographic variation. The Lewiston-Clarkston valley sits at just 740 feet and enjoys one of the warmest microclimates in the inland PNW (Zone 7a), while areas around Sandpoint and the higher Palouse can dip to Zone 5b.

Idaho's Palouse region has some of the finest agricultural soil on the continent — deep, dark loess (wind-deposited topsoil) that farmers from the Midwest would weep over. If you're gardening in the Palouse, your soil is your superpower.

Winter cold and a shorter growing season are your main constraints. But the long summer days (16+ hours of daylight at the solstice) and warm temperatures from June through August make this region surprisingly productive for warm-season crops if you choose the right varieties.

## The 2026 USDA Hardiness Zone Map

The updated USDA map shifted many PNW areas half a zone warmer, confirming what gardeners have noticed: winters aren't what they used to be. Seattle and Portland are now firmly Zone 8b–9a in most neighborhoods. Parts of the urban heat island in Portland touch Zone 9b.

What this means practically:

- **Your last frost date may be earlier** than traditional guidelines suggest
- **Overwintering crops** have higher success rates than a decade ago
- **Subtropical experiments** (figs, hardy kiwi, certain citrus) are more viable west of the Cascades
- **Don't get complacent.** January 2024's Arctic blast sent Western Washington to single digits. Ice storms happen. A warm zone average doesn't mean you won't see exceptional cold.

## Maritime vs. Continental: The Cascade Divide

Understanding this divide is the key to PNW gardening. Here's the cheat sheet:

| Factor | West of Cascades | East of Cascades |
|---|---|---|
| Annual rainfall | 35–90 inches | 8–20 inches |
| Summer highs | 70–85°F | 85–100°F |
| Winter lows | 25–35°F | 0–20°F |
| Frost-free days | 180–250 | 100–170 |
| Soil pH | 5.0–6.5 (acidic) | 6.5–8.0 (neutral to alkaline) |
| Primary challenge | Cool summers, slugs, rain | Short season, irrigation, cold winters |
| Tomato vibes | Stressful | Glorious |
| Winter gardening | Absolutely | With serious protection |

If you garden west of the Cascades, your nemeses are slugs, cool temperatures, and too much moisture. If you garden east, your nemeses are frost, drought, and wind. Both sides have legitimate claims to gardening greatness — just in very different ways.

## Common Mistakes

- **Following national planting calendars.** Zone 8 in Portland is nothing like Zone 8 in Georgia. Maritime Zone 8 has cool summers and mild winters; continental Zone 8 has hot summers and moderate winters. Ignore generic calendars; use this book.
- **Planting tomatoes on Memorial Day because that's what your parents did in the Midwest.** West of the Cascades, soil temperature matters more than air temperature. Wait until soil hits 60°F — often mid-June.
- **Ignoring the dry summer.** New PNW gardeners from the East Coast assume the rain handles watering. July and August are bone-dry. You need irrigation.
- **Giving up on warm-season crops west of the mountains.** You can absolutely grow tomatoes, peppers, and squash in Seattle and Portland — you just need the right varieties and techniques. This book will show you how.

# Chapter 2: Understanding PNW Soil

Dirt is dirt, right? If only. The Pacific Northwest has some of the most varied soil in the country, shaped by volcanism, glaciation, river deposits, and millennia of Douglas fir needles dropping acid (literally) into the ground. What you're working with depends enormously on which side of the Cascades you're on and even which neighborhood you're in.

## West Side Soils: Acidic, Clay-Heavy, and Slug-Friendly

If you garden west of the Cascades, your soil probably has these traits:

**Low pH (acidic).** Years of heavy rainfall leach calcium and magnesium out of the soil, driving pH down. A pH of 5.0–5.5 is common in untreated Western Washington and Oregon soils. Most vegetables prefer 6.0–7.0, so you'll need to add lime — and keep adding it, because the rain keeps leaching.

**Clay content.** The glacial till of the Puget Sound lowlands and the alluvial clay of the Willamette Valley can be brutally heavy. Jory clay in the Willamette Valley is famous — gorgeous red color, excellent structure when worked properly, absolute misery when you try to dig it wet.

**Organic matter.** The wet climate means organic matter decomposes slowly compared to hot southern states. This is actually good news — compost and mulch last longer. Western PNW soils often have naturally higher organic matter than you'd expect.

**The root zone is shallow.** Many urban lots in Seattle and Portland have compacted subsoil from construction, with 6–12 inches of decent topsoil sitting on hardpan. Raised beds aren't just trendy here — they solve real problems.

### How to Fix West Side Soil

**Lime it.** Apply agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) at 50 pounds per 1,000 square feet if you haven't tested, or follow your soil test recommendations. Dolomitic lime adds magnesium too, which PNW soils often lack. Apply in fall so winter rains can work it in. Retest every 2–3 years.

**Add compost.** Two to four inches of quality compost worked into the top 6 inches each spring is the single best thing you can do for clay soil. It improves drainage, adds nutrients, feeds soil biology, and makes the clay workable. Cedar Grove compost (available throughout Western Washington) and Rexius (Oregon) are solid regional options.

**Don't work wet clay.** This is the #1 mistake west-side gardeners make. If you can squeeze a handful of soil and water drips out, step away from the garden. Working wet clay destroys its structure, creating rock-hard clumps that take years to fix. Wait until soil passes the squeeze test: it holds together when pressed but crumbles when poked.

**Consider raised beds.** For heavy clay, compacted urban lots, or areas with construction debris, raised beds filled with a quality soil blend give you immediate results. A 60/40 mix of quality topsoil and compost is a good starting blend. Go at least 12 inches deep — 18 is better.

> **Pro Tip:** Don't buy the cheapest "garden soil" from the big box store. It's often just ground-up bark fines with minimal nutrient value. Source from local landscape supply yards where you can see (and smell) the actual product before buying. Good compost smells earthy. Bad compost smells like a problem.

## East Side Soils: Alkaline, Sandy, and Thirsty

Cross the Cascades and the soil story flips.

**Higher pH (alkaline).** With only 8–15 inches of annual rainfall, calcium and magnesium stay in the soil instead of leaching out. pH values of 7.0–8.5 are common. This can cause nutrient lockout — iron and manganese become unavailable to plants even when they're present in the soil.

**Volcanic and loess soils.** Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond) sits on volcanic pumice and cinder — extremely well-drained, low in organic matter, and not terribly fertile without amendment. The Palouse region of Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho has deep loess topsoil that's genuinely world-class. Know which one you've got.

**Low organic matter.** The dry climate decomposes organic material quickly in summer and doesn't generate the biomass that west-side forests do. Building organic matter is a longer project here.

**Wind erosion.** In exposed areas of Eastern Washington and Oregon, topsoil can blow away during dry, windy spring days. Mulch and cover crops aren't optional — they're erosion control.

### How to Fix East Side Soil

**Add sulfur for alkaline soil.** Elemental sulfur at 10–20 pounds per 1,000 square feet can drop pH by about one point over a growing season. Soil bacteria convert sulfur to sulfuric acid, which acidifies the soil. Apply in spring when soil is warm enough for bacterial activity.

**Compost, compost, compost.** East-side soils need organic matter even more than west-side soils. Three to four inches of compost annually is the goal. It improves water retention in sandy volcanic soil and adds biological life to depleted ground.

**Mulch heavily.** Three to four inches of straw, wood chips, or leaves on top of soil reduces evaporation, moderates soil temperature, and slowly adds organic matter. In the dry east-side climate, mulch can cut irrigation needs by 30–50%.

**Use cover crops.** Winter rye, crimson clover, and Austrian winter peas planted in fall protect soil from wind erosion, add organic matter when tilled in, and fix nitrogen (legumes). This is cheap, effective, and underused by home gardeners.

## Get a Soil Test

Stop guessing. A proper soil test costs $20–$35 and tells you exactly what your soil has, what it needs, and how much to add. Every PNW state has an extension service lab:

- **Washington:** WSU Soil Testing Lab (Pullman)
- **Oregon:** OSU Soil Testing Lab (Corvallis)
- **Idaho:** University of Idaho Analytical Sciences Lab (Moscow)

Test every 2–3 years, or when starting a new garden. Spring or fall are ideal sampling times. Follow the lab's instructions for collecting samples — they want a representative mix from multiple spots in your garden, not one random scoop.

## The Raised Bed Question

Raised beds are wildly popular in the PNW, and for good reason:

- **Drainage:** They solve the waterlogged-clay problem instantly
- **Soil control:** You fill them with exactly what you want
- **Warm faster:** Elevated soil gets more sun exposure and drains better, warming up weeks earlier in spring
- **Accessibility:** Easier on knees and backs
- **Define space:** Clear boundaries help with planning and rotation

**But raised beds aren't free.** A 4×8-foot bed built with cedar boards and filled with quality soil mix costs $150–$300+ depending on materials and soil source. And they dry out faster in summer than in-ground beds, requiring more irrigation.

If your native soil is workable — meaning it drains reasonably, isn't pure clay or pure sand, and isn't contaminated — in-ground gardening with amendments works great and costs less. The Palouse, parts of the Willamette Valley, and many river valley locations have perfectly good garden soil right out of the ground.

> **Pro Tip:** If you're building raised beds, skip pressure-treated lumber. Modern treated wood uses copper compounds (ACQ or CA-B) that are less toxic than the old arsenic-based CCA, but untreated cedar or fir is the PNW gold standard. Western red cedar naturally resists rot for 10–15 years. It's worth the cost.

## Common Mistakes

- **Never liming.** West-side gardeners who skip lime end up with pH below 5.5, which locks out calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Your blossom end rot on tomatoes? Might be a calcium availability issue from low pH, not a watering problem.
- **Tilling wet clay.** Just don't. Wait. The garden will still be there when the soil dries out.
- **Ignoring the difference between soil and dirt.** If you fill a raised bed with "topsoil" from a questionable source, you might end up with weed-seed-laden construction fill. Buy from reputable suppliers and amend generously with compost.
- **Skipping the soil test.** "I'll just add some of everything" is expensive, imprecise, and can create nutrient imbalances. Spend the $25 and know what you're working with.

# Chapter 3: Water-Smart Gardening

Here's the PNW paradox: you spend eight months wishing it would stop raining, and then four months desperately watering. From late June through September, much of the region gets less rainfall than Phoenix. That's not a typo. Seattle's July rainfall average is 0.6 inches. Phoenix gets 0.8.

Understanding how to manage both the wet season surplus and the dry season deficit is essential to gardening here. And if you garden east of the Cascades, water management is the whole game.

## West Side: Too Much, Then Too Little

**Winter and spring (October–June):** Your main water challenge is drainage, not irrigation. Waterlogged soil rots roots, promotes fungal diseases, and keeps soil cold longer in spring. Good drainage — raised beds, sloped sites, amended clay — is your winter strategy.

**Summer (July–September):** The rain stops. Completely. New transplants, fruiting crops, and anything in containers will need consistent irrigation. This catches transplants from the East Coast off guard — they assume Seattle's reputation means they can skip the hose.

### Drip Irrigation: The PNW Standard

Drip irrigation is ideal for the PNW for reasons beyond water efficiency:

- **Keeps foliage dry.** In a region already prone to fungal diseases from spring moisture, wetting leaves during summer is asking for trouble. Drip puts water at the root zone.
- **Efficient.** Drip systems deliver 90%+ of water to the root zone versus 50–70% for overhead sprinklers.
- **Automatable.** A timer-controlled drip system means you're not hand-watering every evening in August when you'd rather be on a patio with a beer.

A basic drip system for a raised bed garden costs $50–$100 in parts and takes an afternoon to install. Use ½-inch mainline with ¼-inch drip tubing or emitters spaced every 12 inches for beds. Run for 30–60 minutes, 3–4 times per week during peak summer, adjusting based on heat and crop needs.

> **Pro Tip:** Put your drip system on a battery-powered timer ($25–$40 at any hardware store). Set it and forget it. The timer pays for itself in saved plants during the first heat wave you forget to water through.

### Soaker Hoses: The Budget Option

Soaker hoses cost less than drip systems and work reasonably well for in-ground gardens. Snake them through beds, cover with mulch, and run for 45–60 minutes per watering session. They're less precise than drip and don't last as long (2–3 seasons), but they're better than overhead sprinklers.

### Overhead Sprinklers: Use Sparingly

Overhead watering promotes foliar diseases (powdery mildew, downy mildew, late blight) and wastes water to evaporation. If overhead is all you've got, water early morning (before 9 AM) so foliage dries quickly. Never water in the evening — wet leaves overnight is an invitation to every fungus in the PNW.

## East Side: Irrigation Is Life

East of the Cascades, rainfall during the growing season is negligible. Without irrigation, you don't have a garden — you have an archaeology project.

**Drip irrigation is non-negotiable.** The math is simple: at 10 inches of annual rainfall and high summer evapotranspiration rates, your garden needs 1–2 inches of water per week from you during summer. Drip delivers it efficiently.

**Mulch is your co-pilot.** Three to four inches of organic mulch (straw, wood chips) reduces evaporation by 30–50%, keeps root zones cooler during 95°F days, and reduces the frequency of watering. Every east-side gardener should be mulching heavily.

**Water deeply and less frequently.** This encourages deep root growth that makes plants more drought-tolerant. One inch of water twice a week beats a quarter-inch every day. Deep roots also access nutrients that shallow-rooted plants miss.

> **Pro Tip:** Invest in a rain gauge and a moisture meter. The gauge tells you when nature handles irrigation (rare in summer but it happens). The moisture meter ($10–$15) tells you what's actually happening at root depth instead of guessing from the surface, which dries out fast in east-side heat.

## Rainwater Harvesting

The PNW dumps enormous amounts of rain on your roof for eight months. Capturing even a fraction of it for summer use makes sense — environmentally and financially.

**How much can you collect?** A 1,000-square-foot roof section captures about 600 gallons per inch of rainfall. In Seattle (37 inches annually), that's over 22,000 gallons. Portland (43 inches) is even better. You won't capture all of it, but even a few barrels make a dent in summer irrigation needs.

**Basic setup:** A 55-gallon rain barrel connected to a downspout costs $50–$150 and provides enough for hand-watering a small bed garden for a week in summer. For serious use, look at 250–500-gallon IBC totes or cistern systems.

**Legal status:** Washington, Oregon, and Idaho all allow residential rainwater harvesting. Oregon was the last holdout but has allowed it since 2009 for rooftop collection.

## Common Mistakes

- **Overwatering in spring.** Cool-season crops in the maritime PNW get plenty of moisture from rain through June. Supplemental watering before July often causes more harm than good — waterlogged soil, shallow roots, fungal diseases.
- **Underwatering in summer.** July and August are genuinely dry. If you're not watering, your tomatoes are suffering. Period.
- **Watering on a fixed schedule regardless of weather.** Use your eyes and your moisture meter. A cool, overcast week in August needs less water than a 90°F heat dome.
- **Skipping mulch.** Bare soil in a PNW summer bakes, cracks, and loses moisture at alarming rates. Mulch is free or cheap (arborist chips, straw) and solves multiple problems at once.

# Chapter 4: Planning Your PNW Garden

The Pacific Northwest rewards planners. With the potential for year-round growing, overlapping seasons, and a climate that's forgiving to cool-season crops but demanding for warm-season ones, a little planning goes a long way.

## The Three PNW Growing Seasons

Unlike most of the country, the PNW doesn't have one growing season — it has three:

**1. Cool season (October–April):** This is the PNW's secret weapon, at least west of the Cascades. Hardy greens, root vegetables, overwintered alliums, and brassicas grow slowly but steadily through winter's short days and mild temperatures. East of the Cascades, this season requires serious cold protection or is simply dormant.

**2. Warm season (May–September):** The main event for tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, corn, and other heat-lovers. West side: shorter and cooler than you'd like. East side: hot and productive.

**3. Fall transition (August–November):** The most underutilized season in PNW gardening. August plantings of fall and winter crops — brassicas, lettuce, spinach, peas — take advantage of warm soil and cooling air temperatures. By October, these crops are established and ready to carry you through winter.

### The Succession Calendar

Smart PNW gardeners overlap these seasons. Here's the concept:

- **February–March:** Start warm-season seeds indoors; direct-sow peas, lettuce, radishes, spinach outside
- **May–June:** Transplant warm-season crops into spots vacated by overwintered crops
- **July–August:** Start fall/winter brassicas and greens; fill gaps as spring crops finish
- **October–November:** Harvest warm-season stragglers; winter garden takes over

This gives you four distinct "waves" of planting and three overlapping harvest periods. No month is wasted.

## Choosing What to Grow

The #1 rule: grow what you'll eat. The #2 rule: grow what's expensive at the store. The #3 rule: grow what grows well in your specific spot.

### Best Bets for West of Cascades

These crops thrive in cool maritime conditions with minimal fuss:

- **Lettuce, spinach, arugula** — practically wild here; bolt-resistant varieties give you 8+ months of harvest
- **Kale, chard** — year-round production; hardier than you'd believe
- **Peas** — cool PNW springs are peak pea weather
- **Brassicas** (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts) — the fall/winter garden MVPs
- **Garlic** — plant in October, harvest in July, no drama
- **Potatoes** — one of the PNW's easiest and most satisfying crops
- **Beans** — bush beans are reliable; pole beans need warm soil but produce heavily
- **Root vegetables** (carrots, beets, parsnips, turnips) — long season allows full development
- **Berries** — technically fruit, but blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries are so productive in PNW conditions they deserve mention

### Best Bets for East of Cascades

The hot summers and long sunny days favor different crops:

- **Tomatoes** — actual red, ripe tomatoes off the vine. West-siders are jealous.
- **Peppers** — sweet and hot varieties both perform well
- **Corn** — enough heat and season length for sweet corn
- **Melons** — with season extension, watermelons and cantaloupes are possible
- **Squash** — winter squash has room to mature fully
- **Beans** — everything from snap beans to dry beans
- **Onions** — long-day varieties thrive in northern latitudes
- **All the cool-season stuff too** — spring and fall are productive for greens and brassicas

### Challenge Crops West of the Cascades

These are doable but require effort:

- **Tomatoes** — choose early varieties (Stupice, Glacier, Early Girl, Sungold), use black plastic mulch, start early indoors, and be patient
- **Peppers** — similar strategy; smaller-fruited varieties (shishito, Padron, Jimmy Nardello) outperform bells
- **Corn** — marginal; needs your warmest spot and early varieties
- **Eggplant** — wall-o-water, black plastic, and prayers
- **Melons** — heroic effort required; possible with plastic mulch, row covers, and short-season varieties in a south-facing spot

## Garden Layout and Sizing

**Start small.** A 4×8-foot raised bed produces a surprising amount of food and is manageable for a beginner. Two beds (64 square feet total) is enough for a steady supply of salad greens, herbs, and a few tomato plants.

**Ambitious but realistic:** Four to six raised beds (4×8 each) or a 200-square-foot in-ground plot gives you room for a diverse garden with cool-season, warm-season, and winter crops.

**Go big:** 400+ square feet or 8+ beds lets you grow a significant portion of your household produce, including storage crops like potatoes, garlic, winter squash, and dried beans.

### Sun Exposure

**Minimum 6 hours of direct sun for fruiting crops.** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, and beans need all the sun they can get — especially west of the Cascades, where overcast days are common. South-facing slopes and walls that reflect heat are gold.

**Leafy greens and root vegetables can get by with 4–5 hours.** This makes them perfect for partially shaded spots that wouldn't support a tomato.

**Beware of the PNW canopy.** The region's magnificent conifers and deciduous trees cast enormous shadows. A spot that looks sunny in March (before deciduous trees leaf out) might be deeply shaded by June. Observe your garden through a full season before committing to permanent beds.

> **Pro Tip:** Measure sun exposure during the summer solstice (June 20–21) for the most accurate picture. That's your peak sun; everything else is less. Apps like Sun Surveyor can map sun paths for your specific location.

## Companion Planting Basics

We'll go deeper in Chapter 20, but here's the quick version for planning:

- **Tomatoes + basil:** Classic combo. Basil may repel certain pests and both like the same conditions.
- **Brassicas + dill/cilantro:** Attract beneficial insects that eat cabbage pests.
- **Beans + corn + squash:** The Three Sisters. Corn provides structure, beans fix nitrogen, squash shades the ground. Works beautifully if you have space.
- **Alliums + carrots:** Onion family plants may confuse carrot rust fly.
- **Lettuce under everything:** Tuck lettuce into partial shade created by taller crops. It's a natural living mulch.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planning only for summer.** The PNW garden can produce twelve months a year. If you're only planting May through August, you're leaving two-thirds of the potential on the table.
- **Ignoring microclimates.** That south-facing wall on your house might be a full zone warmer than the north side of your lot. Use these microclimates strategically — they're free season extension.
- **Planting too much at once.** Succession planting (sowing small amounts every 2–3 weeks) gives you steady harvests instead of a mountain of lettuce followed by nothing.
- **Not planning for the fall garden in summer.** July is when you need to be starting transplants for fall brassicas. By the time you think about it in September, you're already behind.

# Part II: Month-by-Month Growing Guide

This is the core of the book. Each month's chapter tells you exactly what to do, when to do it, and how it varies by region. Where planting dates differ between regions, we'll note it. When we say "west side," we mean Western Washington and Western Oregon. "East side" means Eastern Washington, Eastern Oregon, and Northern Idaho.

# Chapter 5: January — Dreaming and Scheming

January in the PNW is for planning, seed ordering, and staring out rain-spattered windows at your garden. But it's not dormant time — there's real work to do.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Your overwintered crops are in maintenance mode. Kale, leeks, Brussels sprouts, and winter lettuce are producing slowly but still harvestable. Garlic is sleeping underground, growing roots. The soil is soggy — stay off it.

**East side:** The garden is frozen or snow-covered. Nothing's happening outside and that's fine.

## What to Do This Month

### All Regions

- **Order seeds.** Do it now. Popular varieties sell out by February, especially from small seed companies. Territorial Seed (Cottage Grove, OR), Adaptive Seeds (Sweet Home, OR), Uprising Seeds (Bellingham, WA), and Ed Hume Seeds (Puyallup, WA) are all PNW-based companies that know what works here.
- **Review last year.** What worked? What flopped? What did you grow too much of? (If you say zucchini, you're not alone.) Update your garden journal.
- **Plan your layout.** Sketch beds, assign crops, plan rotations. Include fall/winter crops in your plan — not just summer.
- **Clean and sharpen tools.** Sand handles, oil metal, sharpen pruners and hoes. Your future self will thank you.

### West Side Only

- **Harvest overwintered crops** as needed. Kale, leeks, and Brussels sprouts are at their sweetest after frost exposure.
- **Check stored crops** (potatoes, squash, onions) for rot and use anything that's softening.
- **Start onion seeds indoors** late in the month if growing from seed. Onions need a long lead time — 10–12 weeks before transplanting.

### East Side Only

- **Review and repair cold frames and hoop houses.** You'll need them soon.
- **Check your irrigation system** for freeze damage if you left lines in place.

> **Pro Tip:** Make a seed inventory before ordering. Open that box of seed packets from last year and check what you already have. Most vegetable seeds remain viable for 3–5 years if stored cool and dry. Tomatoes, peppers, and brassicas last especially well. Onions and parsnips lose viability after 1–2 years — replace those annually.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting too long to order seeds.** The best small-farm seed companies sell out of popular varieties by mid-February.
- **Forgetting to plan for fall and winter.** January is the time to decide what you'll plant in July/August for winter harvest.
- **Working wet soil.** If the soil squishes, don't touch it. Find an indoor garden project instead.

# Chapter 6: February — The Season Stirs

February is when PNW gardeners start vibrating with impatience. The days are noticeably longer. Crocus and snowdrops are blooming. You want to plant something — anything. Channel that energy wisely.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Soil is still too wet for major work in most years, but late February can offer dry windows. Day length is increasing rapidly — by month's end, you're getting 11+ hours of light. Overwintered crops perk up. Early pollinators appear.

**East side:** Still cold, but the worst is behind you. Snow may still be on the ground, or you may be getting those tantalizing 50°F afternoons that make you forget a freeze is coming next week.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Start warm-season seeds indoors.** Tomatoes and peppers go under lights 6–8 weeks before your last frost date. For most of the west side, that means starting in late February to mid-March.
- **Direct-sow peas** if soil is workable. Peas are tough — they germinate in soil as cool as 40°F. Go for it.
- **Sow spinach, arugula, and lettuce** under row cover or in cold frames for early harvests.
- **Plant bare-root fruit trees, berries, and rhubarb.** February is bare-root season in the PNW. Local nurseries stock them now.
- **Top-dress beds with compost** if soil is dry enough to walk on without sinking.
- **Apply lime** if you didn't in fall. It's less ideal than fall application but still worth doing.
- **Prepare seed-starting area.** Lights, heat mats, trays, sterile seed-starting mix. Don't start seeds in a dark windowsill and expect good results — PNW February light levels are too low. Supplemental lighting is essential.

### East Side

- **Start seeds indoors** for all regions: tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, brassicas.
- **Clean up garden beds** as snow melts. Remove dead plant material.
- **Prune fruit trees** while still dormant.
- **Order or build season extension gear** — row covers, hoop houses, Wall-O-Waters.

> **Pro Tip:** For starting seeds indoors, use T5 fluorescent or LED shop lights hung 2–4 inches above seedlings, running 14–16 hours per day. A two-bulb, 4-foot shop light ($20–$30) is enough for two standard seed trays. Heat mats ($20–$25) are essential for peppers and eggplant, which germinate poorly in cool soil.

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting seeds too early.** Tomato seedlings started in January will be leggy, root-bound monsters by planting time. Six to eight weeks before your last frost is the sweet spot.
- **Direct-sowing warm-season crops.** It's still winter. Beans, squash, and corn wait until May at the earliest, even west side.
- **Ignoring bare-root season.** This is the cheapest time to buy fruit trees, berries, and asparagus crowns. Once they leaf out, prices jump and selection shrinks.

# Chapter 7: March — Spring Planting Begins

March is when the PNW garden wakes up for real. Daffodils are blooming, soil is drying (slowly), and you can finally get your hands dirty. This is the most exciting month for cool-season planting.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Soil temperatures are climbing through the 40s. Overwintered garlic is shooting up. Peas planted in February are sprouting. The first truly dry days appear between rain systems.

**East side:** Snow is melting. Soil is still cold and may be muddy. Late March might offer your first planting opportunities under protection.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Direct-sow outdoors:** peas (more rounds), lettuce, spinach, arugula, radishes, cilantro, carrots (late March), beets, turnips, kale, chard
- **Transplant outdoors:** brassica starts (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower) started indoors in January can go out under row cover
- **Plant potatoes.** Mid-to-late March is traditional potato planting time west of the Cascades. Soil should be 45°F+. Cut seed potatoes a day or two before planting to let cut surfaces callus.
- **Continue starting seeds indoors:** tomatoes, peppers (if not started in February), squash, cucumbers (wait until April)
- **Weed aggressively.** The March moisture flush brings weeds on hard. Get them while they're small. A stirrup hoe on a dry afternoon is your best weapon.
- **Apply slug bait** (iron phosphate-based, such as Sluggo) around tender seedlings. The slug population is ramping up along with everything else.

### East Side

- **Start seeds indoors** if not already going: tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash
- **Prepare beds** as soil dries. Add compost, rake smooth.
- **Direct-sow under protection** (cold frame or hoop house): lettuce, spinach, radishes, peas
- **Late March in mild areas (Lewiston, lower valleys):** try direct-sowing peas and lettuce outdoors

> **Pro Tip:** PNW potato planting pro move: use certified seed potatoes from a local nursery, not grocery store potatoes. Certified seed is disease-tested and vigorous. Grocery store potatoes may carry late blight, scab, or viruses, and many are treated with sprout inhibitor. Favorite PNW varieties: Yukon Gold (all-purpose), Red Pontiac (early, great for new potatoes), German Butterball (storage king), Purple Majesty (fun and nutritious).

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting warm-season crops outdoors.** March is still too cold for tomatoes, peppers, squash, or beans outdoors — even west side. Resist the temptation.
- **Forgetting to harden off transplants.** Indoor-started seedlings need 7–10 days of gradually increasing outdoor exposure before planting out. Skip this and they'll sunburn, windburn, or collapse from temperature shock.
- **Planting carrots too early.** Carrots germinate poorly in cold, wet soil. Late March at the earliest on the west side; wait until April or May east side.

---

# Chapter 8: April — The Garden Accelerates

April is the month where the PNW garden transitions from "cool-season crops doing their thing" to "frantic preparation for warm season." Days are long, rain is tapering, and soil is finally warming.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Soil temperatures reach 50°F+ in most areas. Peas are climbing, lettuce is lush, and brassica transplants are sizing up. Overwintered garlic is knee-high.

**East side:** The season is opening. Frost risk is declining (but not gone). Soil is workable in lower elevations.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Direct-sow outdoors:** more lettuce, beets, carrots, chard, turnips, beans (late April if soil is 55°F+), more peas
- **Transplant outdoors:** more brassicas, lettuce starts, onion starts
- **Prepare warm-season beds.** Lay black plastic mulch on tomato and pepper beds to pre-warm soil. This gains you 2–3 weeks of soil temperature advantage.
- **Set up trellises** for peas and upcoming beans/cucumbers.
- **Continue indoor seedlings:** cucumbers, squash, melons (start these 3–4 weeks before transplant date)
- **Fertilize overwintered crops.** A side-dressing of balanced organic fertilizer (5-5-5) wakes up garlic, brassicas, and perennial herbs.
- **Slug patrol continues.** April is peak slug season. Evening patrol with a headlamp and a bucket of soapy water is disgusting but effective.

### East Side

- **Direct-sow outdoors** (after last frost, or under row cover): lettuce, spinach, peas, radishes, beets, carrots, onion sets
- **Transplant outdoors** (with frost protection available): brassicas, lettuce starts
- **Continue hardening off** seedlings started indoors
- **Install irrigation systems.** Get drip lines laid before planting — it's much easier now than when beds are full.
- **Central Oregon / high elevation:** you may still have frost into late May. Keep most planting under protection.

> **Pro Tip:** Black plastic mulch is a game-changer for warm-season crops in the maritime PNW. Lay it over prepared, fertilized beds 2–4 weeks before transplanting tomatoes or peppers. It raises soil temperature by 5–10°F, suppresses weeds, and reduces splash-up of soil-borne diseases. Cut X-shaped holes for transplants. Red plastic mulch (IRT) is even better for tomatoes — studies show 12–20% yield increases from reflected light.

## Common Mistakes

- **Rushing warm-season transplants outdoors.** A 70°F day in April doesn't mean nights are warm enough. Tomatoes and peppers want nighttime lows consistently above 50°F. On the west side, that's not until late May or June.
- **Ignoring frost protection east side.** A row cover or cold frame is the difference between thriving April seedlings and a sad re-planting in May.
- **Letting spring weeds go to seed.** One chickweed plant produces 2,500 seeds. Get them before they flower.

---

# Chapter 9: May — Warm Season Begins

May is the month when PNW gardeners feel like they're finally, truly gardening. The rain eases. Temperatures climb. And the eternal question arrives: is it warm enough for tomatoes?

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** The "May gray" — cool, overcast days mixed with warm sunny ones — makes for uncertain planting. Soil temperatures are reaching 55–60°F by mid-month in most areas. Spring crops are peaking. The transition to summer mode is underway.

**East side:** Last frost has passed in most lower elevations by mid-May. Higher areas (Bend, upper Idaho) may still see frost through month's end.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Transplant warm-season crops mid-to-late May** (with protection): tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers. Ideal: soil temperature 60°F+, nighttime lows consistently above 50°F. Use Wall-O-Waters, row covers, or cloches for early transplants.
- **Direct-sow beans** once soil is 60°F. Bush beans first; pole beans when it's a bit warmer.
- **Direct-sow squash, cucumbers, and corn** late May in warm spots, or start indoors and transplant in June.
- **Succession-sow lettuce, radishes, and cilantro** every 2–3 weeks.
- **Harvest spring crops:** lettuce, spinach, radishes, peas are all producing now.
- **Thin direct-seeded crops.** Carrots and beets need space. Thin to 2–3 inches apart and eat the thinnings.

### East Side

- **After last frost:** transplant everything — tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash, cucumbers.
- **Direct-sow:** beans, corn, squash, cucumbers, melons, sunflowers.
- **Continue cool-season succession:** lettuce, radishes, and greens appreciate the moderate May temperatures before summer heat arrives.
- **Mulch beds** after soil has warmed. Straw or wood chips, 3–4 inches.
- **Turn on irrigation.** Monitor soil moisture — May can still be dry between rain events.

> **Pro Tip:** Wall-O-Waters (those red plastic tepees filled with water) are a PNW cult classic for good reason. Place them over tomato transplants 2 weeks before planting (or at planting time) and they create a mini-greenhouse that can protect down to 16°F and raise daytime temperatures by 10–20°F. They're ugly, awkward to fill, and absolutely worth it. Remove them when nighttime temperatures are consistently above 55°F — usually mid-June.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting tomatoes in cold soil.** A 65°F air temperature with 52°F soil is not warm enough. Tomato roots in cold soil stall, turn purple, and take weeks to recover. Wait until soil is 60°F+ (use a soil thermometer, $10).
- **Ripping out cool-season crops too early.** Peas and lettuce are still producing in May. Let them finish before clearing beds for warm-season crops.
- **Not succession-planting.** One big planting of lettuce = one big harvest followed by nothing. Small sowings every 2 weeks = lettuce all season.

---

# Chapter 10: June — Peak Planting, Peak Potential

June is the PNW's golden month. The days are the longest of the year (16+ hours of light), the weather is warming, and the garden is firing on all cylinders. This is when you stop planning and start managing.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** The famous "June Gloom" — marine overcast layer — keeps things cooler than you'd like through mid-month in some years. Other years, June is glorious. Soil temperatures are finally warm. Spring crops are finishing. Warm-season crops are establishing.

**East side:** Summer is here. Temperatures are climbing into the 80s and 90s. Long days and warm nights mean rapid growth for everything.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Transplant remaining warm-season crops** that didn't go out in May. June is fine for tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers — in fact, early June transplants in warm soil often catch up to May transplants that sat in cold ground.
- **Direct-sow more beans,** succession lettuce (heat-tolerant varieties like Jericho or Muir), basil, dill, and summer herbs.
- **Remove Wall-O-Waters and cloches** from tomatoes once nights stay above 55°F.
- **Begin training and staking** tomatoes, cucumbers, and beans on their supports.
- **Begin summer watering.** The rain is tapering off. Check soil moisture and start irrigation as needed, especially for new transplants.
- **Side-dress fruiting crops** with balanced fertilizer or compost as they begin blooming.

### East Side

- **Everything is growing.** Focus on maintenance: watering, weeding, mulching.
- **Succession-plant beans, cucumbers, and summer squash** for extended harvest.
- **Begin watching for pests:** aphids, flea beetles, cucumber beetles, squash bugs.
- **Deep-water trees and perennials** as dry season establishes.

### All Regions

- **Start fall brassica seeds indoors** late in the month. Brussels sprouts, fall cabbage, and broccoli need 10–12 weeks before transplanting in August. This is the step most gardeners miss.
- **Weed consistently.** Fifteen minutes of weeding twice a week beats a four-hour marathon once a month.

> **Pro Tip:** The west-side "June Gloom" frustrates gardeners, but it's actually great for transplanting. Overcast skies reduce transplant shock. If you get a stretch of cloudy days in June, use it as your transplanting window.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not starting fall crops now.** Brussels sprouts, fall/winter cauliflower, and storage cabbage need to be seeded in June for an August transplant. Mark your calendar. This is the single most important step for a productive winter garden.
- **Neglecting water as rain decreases.** The transition from "rain handles it" to "I need to water" sneaks up on you. New transplants are especially vulnerable.
- **Letting peas go too long.** Harvest peas regularly or they stop producing. Pull spent pea plants and compost them — their nitrogen-fixing roots benefit the soil.

---

# Chapter 11: July — Summer in Full Swing

July in the PNW is gorgeous. Blue skies, warm days, long evenings, and a garden that's producing faster than you can eat it. This is also the month when water management becomes your primary job.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** The rain has stopped. Summer temperatures average 75–80°F with occasional spikes into the 90s. Tomatoes are flowering and setting fruit. Beans are producing. Squash is taking over. Lettuce wants to bolt.

**East side:** Peak summer heat. Highs in the 90s to 100s. Everything that's irrigated is thriving. Everything that isn't is crispy.

## What to Do This Month

### All Regions

- **Water consistently.** This is non-negotiable. Drip systems should be running regularly. Hand-waterers need to be disciplined.
- **Harvest daily.** Zucchini left for two days becomes a baseball bat. Beans get tough. Cucumbers turn into clubs. Regular picking encourages continued production.
- **Continue succession-sowing:** lettuce (heat-tolerant varieties), beans, beets, carrots (for fall harvest), cilantro, dill.
- **Start fall transplants:** kale, collards, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage seedlings for August transplanting.
- **Mulch, mulch, mulch.** If you haven't mulched yet, do it now. Every exposed inch of soil is losing moisture.

### West Side

- **Pinch tomato suckers** (for indeterminate varieties) to focus energy on fruit production. In the short PNW season, you want fewer, riper tomatoes rather than a massive plant with green fruit at first frost.
- **Watch for late blight.** Cool, damp conditions (even in summer) can trigger *Phytophthora infestans* — the same disease that caused the Irish Potato Famine. Symptoms: brown/black lesions on stems and leaves, white fuzzy growth underneath. If you see it, remove affected tissue immediately. Copper fungicide is the organic preventative.
- **Harvest garlic** when the bottom 3–4 leaves have browned but 5–6 green leaves remain (typically mid-July). Don't wait too long — overripe garlic splits and stores poorly.
- **Pull spent peas** and replace with fall crops or late beans.

### East Side

- **Shade sensitive crops.** Lettuce, spinach, and cilantro appreciate 30–50% shade cloth during triple-digit heat.
- **Water deeply in heat.** Tomatoes may need daily drip irrigation during heat waves. Wilting in afternoon heat is normal; wilting in the morning means they need water now.
- **Watch for spider mites.** Hot, dry conditions are spider mite paradise. Fine webbing on undersides of leaves is the telltale sign. Spray with a strong jet of water or use insecticidal soap.

> **Pro Tip:** July garlic harvest is a ritual worth savoring. Dig (don't pull) bulbs carefully. Cure in a warm, dry, shaded spot with good airflow for 2–3 weeks — a covered porch or garage works well. Don't wash the bulbs; brush off soil after curing. Properly cured garlic stores for 6–8 months. Braid softneck varieties for hanging storage and Instagram points.

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring water for a long weekend.** A three-day trip in late July without irrigation can seriously damage or kill heat-stressed crops. Set up a timer or ask a neighbor.
- **Not harvesting summer squash small enough.** Zucchini at 6–8 inches: delicious. Zucchini at 14 inches: bland, seedy, and takes up the whole crisper. Pick early and often.
- **Forgetting that fall is coming.** July is the time to plant for fall and winter. Every day you delay is a day your winter garden won't have.

---

# Chapter 12: August — Fall Garden Launch

August is the pivot month. Summer crops are still producing, but the smart PNW gardener is already looking ahead. This is the most important planting month for winter food.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Still warm and dry, but days are noticeably shorter. Tomatoes are ripening (finally). Summer squash is unstoppable. The last major harvest push for warm-season crops begins.

**East side:** Heat is peaking or just starting to ease. Nighttime temperatures begin dropping. First hints of fall appear.

## What to Do This Month

### All Regions

- **Transplant fall brassicas** (started in June/July): broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, collards. Get them in the ground by mid-August for a strong fall and winter garden.
- **Direct-sow fall crops:** lettuce, spinach, arugula, radishes, turnips, Asian greens (mizuna, tatsoi, bok choy), cilantro, dill.
- **Plant overwintering onions** (sets or transplants) in mid-to-late August. Varieties like Walla Walla Sweet (for east side) or any short-day overwintering type (west side) go in now for harvest next summer.
- **Continue harvesting** summer crops vigorously. Freeze, can, dry, or give away the excess.
- **Maintain irrigation.** August is typically the driest month in the PNW. Don't slack now.

### West Side

- **Sow overwintering crops** for spring harvest: purple sprouting broccoli, overwintering cauliflower, overwintering lettuce varieties (Winter Density, Winter Marvel).
- **Plant garlic? Not yet.** October is garlic time. But order your seed garlic now from specialty suppliers before they sell out.
- **Top tomatoes** late in the month — remove growing tips of indeterminate plants to redirect energy to ripening existing fruit. Count backward from your average first frost date (mid-October to mid-November): tomatoes need 6–8 weeks from flower to ripe fruit. Flowers appearing after August aren't going to make it.

### East Side

- **Start transitioning to fall mode.** As summer crops finish, clear beds and plant cool-season crops.
- **Plan for frost protection.** First frost can arrive as early as late September in higher elevations.
- **Direct-sow a cover crop** (winter rye, crimson clover) in beds that are done for the season.

> **Pro Tip:** August-planted fall lettuce is some of the best you'll ever grow. The warm soil gives fast germination, the cooling temperatures prevent bolting, and the gentle fall weather produces tender, sweet leaves that summer lettuce can't match. Sow every two weeks from August 1 through September 15 for continuous fall harvest.

## Common Mistakes

- **Missing the fall planting window.** If brassica transplants aren't in the ground by mid-August (west side) or early August (east side), they won't size up before short days slow growth to a crawl. This is the #1 reason people say "I tried winter gardening and it didn't work."
- **Stopping watering because "fall is coming."** August and September are dry months. Water right up until the rains return (usually October).
- **Not ordering seed garlic.** The good stuff sells out fast. Order from Filaree Garlic Farm (Okanogan, WA), Territorial Seed, or local seed swaps.

# Chapter 13: September — Fall Transition

September is bittersweet. The summer garden is winding down, the fall garden is ramping up, and the light is shifting in that unmistakably autumn way. But there's real productivity left — some of the best harvests of the year happen this month.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Tomatoes are in peak ripeness (finally!). Fall-planted crops are establishing. Days are still warm but nights are cooling. The rain may return late in the month, or may hold off until October.

**East side:** First frost threatens in higher elevations. Lower elevations have a few weeks left. The garden is transitioning fast.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Harvest tomatoes** urgently. Watch the weather — once night temperatures dip below 50°F consistently, ripening slows dramatically. Pick anything showing color and ripen indoors if frost threatens.
- **Direct-sow** last rounds of: spinach, lettuce (overwintering types), arugula, mâche (corn salad — a cold-hardy European green that loves PNW winters), claytonia (miner's lettuce — native to the PNW).
- **Protect fall brassica transplants** from cabbage worms with row cover (Reemay or Agribon). September's last generation of cabbage white butterflies is aggressive.
- **Cure winter squash** after harvest. Leave on the vine until stems dry and skins can't be dented with a fingernail. Cure in a warm spot (80°F) for 10 days, then store at 50–55°F.
- **Begin saving seeds** from open-pollinated varieties if that's your thing. Tomatoes, beans, peas, and lettuce are easy starters.

### East Side

- **Watch for frost.** Have row covers and blankets ready. A single frost can wipe out tender crops while leaving cold-hardy ones fine.
- **Harvest everything tender** before first frost: tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, beans, squash, cucumbers.
- **Plant garlic** in late September or early October. East side garlic goes in a bit earlier than west side because it needs time to root before hard freeze.
- **Sow cover crops** on finished beds. Winter rye is the east-side standard — sow by October 1 for good establishment.

### All Regions

- **Clean up spent crops.** Don't leave dead tomato plants or bean vines in the garden over winter — they harbor diseases and pests. Compost healthy material; trash anything diseased.
- **Take notes.** What varieties performed? What failed? Write it down while it's fresh.

> **Pro Tip:** Green tomatoes at season's end? Don't throw them away. Wrap individually in newspaper and store in a single layer in a cool (60–65°F) dark place. Check weekly — they'll ripen over the next 4–6 weeks. Or make green tomato salsa, fried green tomatoes, or green tomato chutney. There are no bad options.

## Common Mistakes

- **Leaving tomatoes on the vine too long.** Once night temperatures drop below 50°F, they're done ripening outside. Pick them and bring them in.
- **Forgetting garlic.** Order and plant in September (east side) or October (west side). It's the easiest overwintering crop you'll ever grow.
- **Not covering fall brassicas.** Row cover does triple duty: frost protection, pest exclusion, and a few degrees of warmth. It's cheap insurance.

---

# Chapter 14: October — The Winter Garden Arrives

October is when the west side of the PNW shows its true gardening potential. As the rest of the country is putting their gardens to bed, you're just hitting your stride with the winter growing season.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** The rains return (or are about to). Fall brassicas are sizing up beautifully. Overwintered crops are established. Garlic goes in the ground. The first frost may nip the last tomato plants, but hardy crops don't flinch.

**East side:** First hard frosts have arrived or are imminent. The growing season is effectively over for unprotected crops. Clean-up and cover cropping are the priorities.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Plant garlic.** October is prime garlic planting time. Plant individual cloves 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart, pointy end up. Mulch with 3–4 inches of straw or leaves. Walk away. Check back in July.
- **Transplant overwintering onion starts** if not done in August.
- **Last chance direct-sowing:** mâche, claytonia, spinach. These are cold-hardy enough to establish in October and overwinter.
- **Set up winter protection** for tender fall crops: cold frames, low tunnels with row cover, or hoop houses.
- **Clean up summer beds.** Remove all dead warm-season plants. Compost or dispose. Apply lime to acidic beds. Spread a layer of compost or plant a cover crop.
- **Collect and shred fallen leaves** for mulch. Leaf mulch is free, abundant, and excellent for insulating overwintering crops and improving soil.

### East Side

- **Plant garlic** if not done in September.
- **Finish cover crop seeding.** Winter rye, Austrian winter peas, or crimson clover. Get it in before ground freezes.
- **Put the garden to bed.** Clear debris, add compost, mulch perennials, turn off and drain irrigation lines.
- **Protect perennial herbs** (rosemary, thyme, sage) with mulch or move containers to sheltered spots.

> **Pro Tip:** The key to PNW garlic success: use locally grown seed garlic adapted to your climate, plant in October, mulch heavily, and forget about it until spring. Hardneck varieties (Music, Chesnok Red, German Extra Hardy) are best for cold east-side winters. Softneck varieties (Inchelium Red, Nootka Rose, Silverskin) work well west side and store longer. Plant both if you can't decide.

## Common Mistakes

- **Putting the entire garden to bed.** West of the Cascades, October is a planting month, not a shutting-down month. Your winter garden is just getting started.
- **Skipping the garlic.** Seriously, plant garlic. It's the easiest, most rewarding, and most space-efficient overwintering crop. If you plant nothing else in fall, plant garlic.
- **Leaving bare soil over winter.** Bare soil erodes, compacts, and loses nutrients to leaching rain. Cover it with mulch, cover crops, or growing plants.

---

# Chapter 15: November — Settling In

November is about maintenance, protection, and patience. The garden is either growing slowly (west side) or sleeping (east side). Your job is to keep it safe and plan for spring.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Days are short (barely 9 hours by month's end) and rain is steady. Growth has slowed dramatically, but it hasn't stopped. Hardy crops — kale, leeks, Brussels sprouts, winter lettuce, mâche — are holding strong. Garlic has sprouted green shoots (totally normal and fine).

**East side:** Hard freezes are regular. The garden is dormant unless you have a heated greenhouse or serious cold frames.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Harvest Brussels sprouts** after a few hard frosts — they're noticeably sweeter. Cut from the bottom up.
- **Harvest leeks, kale, chard, and winter lettuce** as needed for meals. These are your workhorses through the dark months.
- **Check winter protection.** Make sure row covers and cold frames are secure. Repair any storm damage.
- **Spread leaves or straw** as mulch over garlic and overwintering crops.
- **Clean and store tools.** Winter rain accelerates rust. Oil metal, hang tools off wet ground.
- **Continue slug patrol.** Slugs don't stop for winter in the maritime PNW. They love the cool, wet conditions. Iron phosphate bait (Sluggo) around winter crops is worthwhile.

### East Side

- **Mulch heavily** over garlic beds and any perennials.
- **Drain and store drip irrigation** components to prevent freeze cracking.
- **Enjoy the off-season.** Sharpen tools, organize the seed cabinet, browse seed catalogs, and plan next year.

> **Pro Tip:** Brussels sprouts are the ultimate PNW winter crop. Plant in June, transplant in August, and they'll be producing from November through February. Frost converts their starches to sugars, making November sprouts far sweeter than anything you've bought at a store. Varieties to try: Long Island Improved (compact), Gustus (excellent flavor), Diablo (reliable).

## Common Mistakes

- **Neglecting the winter garden.** It's easy to stop visiting the garden when it's dark and wet. But overwintered crops still need occasional attention — slug control, storm damage repair, and harvesting to encourage continued production.
- **Forgetting to harvest.** Kale, leeks, and Brussels sprouts are sitting out there waiting for you. Use them.
- **Assuming nothing's growing.** Growth is slow, but it's happening. Plants are building root mass even when top growth stalls. By February, they'll explode when day length increases.

---

# Chapter 16: December — Rest, Reflect, and Harvest

December is the quietest month in the PNW garden, and that's okay. The shortest days of the year mean minimal plant growth, but there's still food to harvest and planning to do.

## What's Happening in the Garden

**West side:** Growth is at its annual minimum. The solstice (December 21) gives you barely 8.5 hours of daylight in Seattle, and much of that is under cloud cover. Overwintered crops are in survival mode, not growth mode. Garlic is dormant underground.

**East side:** Snow cover, frozen ground, dormancy. The garden is asleep.

## What to Do This Month

### West Side

- **Harvest overwintered crops** for holiday meals: kale, leeks, Brussels sprouts, winter carrots (if you planted them), mâche, claytonia.
- **Protect against hard freezes.** Most years, the west side stays above 25°F, but Arctic outbreaks happen. Have row cover or old blankets ready for unusual cold snaps.
- **Enjoy the quiet.** This is the one month where the garden genuinely doesn't need much from you. Read seed catalogs, plan next year, and rest.

### East Side

- **Check stored produce** — potatoes, squash, onions, garlic, canned goods. Use anything that's showing age.
- **Sharpen and maintain tools.**
- **Dream big.** Next year's garden starts in your imagination this month.

### All Regions

- **Review the year.** What were your biggest successes? Biggest failures? Best varieties? Worst pests? Write a year-end garden review and save it. Future you will be grateful.
- **Order early.** Some seed companies open orders in December, and early-bird ordering avoids the February rush.
- **Gift garden stuff.** Seeds, tools, garden books (like this one) make excellent gifts for gardening friends.

> **Pro Tip:** December-harvested root vegetables (carrots, parsnips, beets) that have been through frosts are extraordinarily sweet. Cold converts their starches to sugars as a natural antifreeze. Parsnips, especially, transform from "okay" to "like candy" after a few weeks of frost. Leave them in the ground until you need them — the garden is their best storage.

## Common Mistakes

- **Leaving the garden completely ignored.** Even in December, a quick weekly walk-through catches problems — storm-damaged row covers, slug damage, frozen drip lines.
- **Not resting.** Gardening is seasonal for a reason. The garden is resting. You should too. There will be plenty to do in February.

# Part III: Vegetable Profiles

# Chapter 17: Warm-Season Vegetables A–Z

These crops need warm soil (60°F+), warm air, and the longest possible growing season. West of the Cascades, they require strategy. East of the Cascades, they're in their element.

## Beans (Bush and Pole)

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow when soil reaches 60°F. West side: late May–June. East side: mid-May–June.  
**Spacing:** Bush: 4–6 inches apart in rows 18 inches apart. Pole: 6 inches apart at base of support.  
**Sun:** Full sun (6+ hours)  
**Water:** 1 inch per week; consistent moisture during flowering and pod set  
**Days to harvest:** Bush: 50–60 days. Pole: 60–70 days.

**PNW notes:** Beans are reliable performers throughout the PNW. Bush beans (Provider, Contender, Blue Lake Bush) are the safe bet — plant, wait 55 days, harvest. Pole beans (Blue Lake Pole, Kentucky Wonder, Fortex) take longer but produce more per square foot and keep producing until frost.

Wait for warm soil. Beans planted in cold soil rot before germinating. If you're impatient, pre-warm beds with black plastic for two weeks. Inoculating seeds with rhizobium bacteria (available at garden stores) can improve nitrogen fixation, especially in new garden beds.

**Varieties for PNW:** Provider (bush, reliable, tolerant of cool soil), Blue Lake Bush (classic), Fortex (pole, incredible flavor, long pods), Dragon Tongue (bush, beautiful purple-streaked), Borlotto (shell bean, gorgeous and productive).

**Common mistakes:** Planting in cold soil. Not providing support for pole varieties early enough. Letting pods get too large and tough before picking.

## Corn

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow when soil reaches 65°F. West side: late May–June (marginal). East side: mid-May–June.  
**Spacing:** 12 inches apart in blocks of at least 4 rows (for pollination). Rows 30 inches apart.  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1.5 inches per week; critical during tasseling and silk emergence  
**Days to harvest:** 60–100 days depending on variety

**PNW notes:** Corn is marginal west of the Cascades — the cool maritime summer doesn't provide enough heat units for many varieties. If you're determined, choose early varieties (60–70 days): Earlivee, Early Sunglow, or Trinity. Plant in your warmest spot with black plastic mulch.

East of the Cascades, corn is straightforward. You have the heat and the season. Plant in blocks (not single rows) for proper wind pollination.

**Common mistakes:** Planting in a single row instead of blocks. Inadequate water during pollination. Choosing long-season varieties west of the Cascades.

## Cucumbers

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Transplant or direct-sow when soil reaches 65°F. West side: June. East side: late May–June.  
**Spacing:** 12 inches apart on a trellis, or 36 inches apart if sprawling.  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week; consistent moisture reduces bitterness  
**Days to harvest:** 50–65 days

**PNW notes:** Cucumbers perform well in both maritime and continental PNW climates, though west-side gardeners benefit from trellising (better airflow reduces disease in humid conditions). Choose disease-resistant varieties — powdery mildew is the most common cucumber problem in the PNW.

**Varieties for PNW:** Marketmore 76 (slicing, disease-resistant, reliable), Diva (thin-skinned, burpless, parthenocarpic — sets fruit without pollination), Picolino (cocktail cucumber, adorable and productive), National Pickling (pickling, prolific).

**Common mistakes:** Direct-sowing too early in cold soil. Inconsistent watering (leads to bitter and misshapen fruit). Not trellising — ground-sprawling cukes are slug magnets west of the Cascades.

## Eggplant

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Transplant when soil reaches 65°F and nighttime lows stay above 55°F. West side: mid-June at earliest. East side: late May–June.  
**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun, hottest spot possible  
**Water:** 1 inch per week  
**Days to harvest:** 65–80 days from transplant

**PNW notes:** Eggplant is a challenge west of the Cascades. It needs more heat than tomatoes and is less forgiving of cool nights. Grow in the hottest microclimate you have — south-facing wall, black plastic mulch, row cover. Small-fruited Asian varieties (Ichiban, Ping Tung Long) outperform globe types in cool climates.

East of the Cascades, eggplant is much more cooperative. Give it full sun, warm soil, and consistent water, and it'll reward you.

**Varieties for PNW west:** Ichiban (slender Japanese, early), Ping Tung Long (prolific, holds well), Fairy Tale (compact, beautiful, good for containers).  
**Varieties for PNW east:** Black Beauty (classic globe), Orient Express (early, productive), any variety that suits your taste.

**Common mistakes:** Planting too early. Not providing enough heat. Expecting full-sized globe eggplant from a west-side garden — go Asian varieties instead.

## Melons

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Transplant when soil reaches 70°F. West side: late June (heroic effort). East side: late May–June.  
**Spacing:** 24–36 inches apart on a trellis, or 4–6 feet apart if sprawling.  
**Sun:** Full sun, all-day  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week; reduce watering as fruit ripens for better flavor  
**Days to harvest:** 70–90 days from transplant

**PNW notes:** Melons are the ultimate challenge crop west of the Cascades. Cool nights, short warm season, and marginal heat accumulation mean you need every trick: black plastic mulch, row cover, Wall-O-Water, south-facing wall, short-season varieties. Minnesota Midget (cantaloupe, 60–70 days) and Blacktail Mountain (watermelon, 70 days) are your best bets.

East of the Cascades, melons are achievable with standard warm-season practices. Cantaloupe does better than watermelon in shorter-season east-side areas.

**Common mistakes:** Trying west of the Cascades without season extension. Overwatering during ripening. Not choosing short-season varieties.

## Peppers (Sweet and Hot)

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Transplant when soil reaches 65°F and nighttime lows stay above 55°F. West side: mid-June. East side: late May–June.  
**Spacing:** 18 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun, 8+ hours ideal  
**Water:** 1 inch per week; slightly dry conditions encourage heat in hot peppers  
**Days to harvest:** 60–90 days from transplant (depending on type)

**PNW notes:** Peppers need heat — more than tomatoes. West of the Cascades, small-fruited varieties drastically outperform bells. Shishito, Padron, Jimmy Nardello, and Lunchbox are all prolific in maritime conditions. Full-sized bell peppers struggle to ripen and often stay green.

East of the Cascades, bell peppers and large hot peppers perform well. You have the heat and sun they crave.

**Varieties for PNW west:** Shishito (prolific, easy, delicious blistered), Jimmy Nardello (sweet Italian frying pepper, legendary flavor), Padron (tapas classic, occasionally hot), Carmen (early red Italian, one of the few large peppers that reliably ripens west side).  
**Varieties for PNW east:** All of the above plus: King of the North (bell, bred for short seasons), Ace (bell, early), California Wonder (bell, classic), any hot pepper your heart desires.

**Common mistakes:** Planting too early. Choosing full-sized bells in a maritime climate and being disappointed. Not hardening off properly — peppers are more cold-sensitive than tomatoes.

## Squash (Summer and Winter)

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow or transplant when soil reaches 65°F. West side: late May–June. East side: mid-May–June.  
**Spacing:** Summer: 24 inches apart. Winter: 36–48 inches apart.  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week  
**Days to harvest:** Summer: 45–55 days. Winter: 85–110 days.

**PNW notes:** Summer squash (zucchini, yellow crookneck, pattypan) is dead easy throughout the PNW. Two plants feed a family of four and half the neighborhood. The main problem is overproduction.

Winter squash needs a longer season. West of the Cascades, choose varieties under 100 days: Delicata (80 days, exceptional flavor), Sweet Dumpling (90 days), Butternut (100 days — tight but doable). East of the Cascades, the full range of winter squash is available.

**Powdery mildew** is the primary squash disease in the PNW. Choose resistant varieties (Dunja zucchini, Butterscotch PMR butternut) and ensure good airflow.

**Common mistakes:** Planting too many zucchini (two plants is plenty — really). Not choosing short-season winter squash varieties for the west side. Harvesting winter squash before it's fully mature — the skin should be hard enough that you can't dent it with your fingernail.

## Tomatoes

**Type:** Warm-season annual  
**When to plant:** Transplant when soil reaches 60°F and nighttime lows stay above 50°F. West side: late May–mid-June. East side: mid-May–June.  
**Spacing:** 24–36 inches apart (staked/caged)  
**Sun:** Full sun, 8+ hours, hottest spot  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week; consistent moisture prevents cracking and blossom end rot  
**Days to harvest:** 55–85 days from transplant

**PNW notes:** Tomatoes are the holy grail of west-side PNW gardening. You *can* grow great tomatoes in Seattle and Portland — but you need the right varieties and techniques.

### West-Side Tomato Strategy

1. **Choose early varieties.** Anything over 75 days from transplant is risky. Best bets: Sungold (cherry, 57 days, universally loved), Stupice (slicer, 60 days, Czech variety bred for cool climates), Glacier (slicer, 55 days), Early Girl (slicer, 62 days), Siletz (determinate slicer, 65 days, bred at OSU for Oregon conditions), Legend (determinate, 68 days, also from OSU, disease-resistant).
2. **Pre-warm soil.** Black or red plastic mulch, laid 2–4 weeks before planting.
3. **Use Wall-O-Waters** at planting time for 2–4 weeks of extra protection.
4. **Prune aggressively.** Indeterminate varieties should be pruned to 2–3 main stems. Remove suckers below the first flower cluster. This concentrates energy into fewer, earlier-ripening fruit.
5. **Top plants in late August.** Cut off the growing tip to redirect energy from new growth to ripening existing fruit.
6. **Overhead cover helps.** A simple lean-to of clear plastic over tomatoes (open on the sides for airflow) keeps rain off foliage, reducing late blight risk and creating a warmer microclimate.

### East-Side Tomato Strategy

You have heat. Use it. Full-sized slicers, beefsteaks, paste tomatoes, heirlooms — all are viable. Standard tomato culture applies: stake or cage, water consistently, fertilize at planting and when fruiting begins. Biggest risk is sunscald on exposed fruit during heat waves — leave enough foliage to shade fruit.

**Varieties for PNW west:** Sungold (cherry, non-negotiable), Stupice (early slicer), Siletz (determinate, reliable), Legend (determinate, disease-resistant), Juliet (grape, prolific, crack-resistant), Black Cherry (incredible flavor).  
**Varieties for PNW east:** All of the above plus: Brandywine (heirloom, if you have 80+ days), San Marzano (paste), Cherokee Purple (heirloom, stunning flavor), Celebrity (all-rounder), Roma (paste, reliable).

**Common mistakes:** Planting too early in cold soil. Choosing 80+ day varieties west of the Cascades. Overwatering (leads to cracking and diluted flavor). Not pruning indeterminate varieties in the short west-side season. Ignoring late blight — it can destroy a tomato patch in a week.

# Chapter 18: Cool-Season Vegetables A–Z

These crops thrive in the PNW's cool temperatures and long mild seasons. Many perform best in fall, winter, and spring — exactly when the rest of the country's gardens are dormant. This is the PNW's unfair advantage.

## Arugula

**Type:** Cool-season annual  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow March–May for spring; August–September for fall/winter. Year-round in mild west-side areas with succession sowing.  
**Spacing:** Scatter seed and thin to 4–6 inches, or harvest as baby greens at any spacing.  
**Sun:** Full sun to part shade  
**Water:** Consistent moisture  
**Days to harvest:** 21 days (baby) to 40 days (full-sized)

**PNW notes:** Arugula is practically a weed in the PNW — and that's a compliment. It germinates fast, grows fast, and self-sows enthusiastically. Spring and fall sowings give the best flavor; summer arugula bolts quickly and turns fiery. The wild/sylvetta type is slower-growing, more peppery, and more bolt-resistant than standard arugula.

**Common mistakes:** Sowing too thickly. Letting it bolt in summer heat (bolt = bitter). Not succession-sowing for continuous harvest.

## Beets

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual)  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow April–July for summer/fall harvest. West side: also August for late fall harvest.  
**Spacing:** 3–4 inches apart (each "seed" is actually a cluster — thin to one seedling per spot)  
**Sun:** Full sun to light shade  
**Water:** 1 inch per week; consistent moisture prevents woody roots  
**Days to harvest:** 50–65 days

**PNW notes:** Beets are easy and versatile in the PNW. Both roots and greens are edible and nutritious. They tolerate the acidic west-side soil better than many vegetables (pH 6.0–7.0 is ideal, but they manage down to 5.5). Golden beets (Touchstone Gold) don't stain everything they touch. Chioggia beets are beautiful sliced raw. Bull's Blood has the best greens.

**Common mistakes:** Not thinning — crowded beets stay small. Harvesting too late — beets over 3 inches in diameter get woody and fibrous. Forgetting to eat the greens — they're better than chard.

## Broccoli

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual)  
**When to plant:** Transplant April–May for spring harvest; transplant July–August for fall harvest (fall plantings are generally better in the PNW).  
**Spacing:** 18 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week; consistent moisture for best head development  
**Days to harvest:** 60–80 days from transplant

**PNW notes:** Fall broccoli outperforms spring broccoli in the PNW. Cool fall temperatures produce tight, sweet heads without the bolting risk that warm spring weather brings. Start seeds indoors in June, transplant in August, and harvest October–November.

For spring plantings, choose bolt-resistant varieties (Belstar, Gypsy) and transplant as early as possible with row cover protection.

Sprouting broccoli (purple sprouting, white sprouting) is a PNW secret weapon — plant in summer, overwinter, and harvest abundant small florets from February through April. It fills the "hungry gap" between stored winter crops and new spring harvests.

**Varieties for PNW:** Belstar (reliable, heat-tolerant for spring), Arcadia (cold-hardy, great for fall/winter), Purple Sprouting (overwinter for spring harvest), De Cicco (heirloom, prolific side shoots).

**Common mistakes:** Spring plantings bolting in unexpected warm spells. Not covering with row cover against cabbage worms. Missing the fall planting window.

## Brussels Sprouts

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual)  
**When to plant:** Start seeds indoors in May–June. Transplant July–early August.  
**Spacing:** 24 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week  
**Days to harvest:** 90–110 days from transplant

**PNW notes:** Brussels sprouts are the trophy crop of the PNW winter garden. They need a long season (start early!) and improve dramatically with frost exposure. Harvest from the bottom up starting in November, and they'll keep producing into February.

**Varieties for PNW:** Long Island Improved (compact, reliable), Gustus (exceptional flavor), Diablo (uniform, productive), Franklin (early, good for shorter-season east side).

**Common mistakes:** Starting too late. Plants need to be substantial (2+ feet tall) before short days halt growth in October. June-started seeds, August-transplanted, November-harvested is the rhythm.

## Cabbage

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual)  
**When to plant:** Transplant March–April for spring; transplant July–August for fall/storage.  
**Spacing:** 18 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week  
**Days to harvest:** 65–95 days from transplant

**PNW notes:** Cabbage is a PNW workhorse. Spring plantings give you fresh cabbage for summer coleslaw. Fall plantings (transplanted in August) produce dense storage heads that keep for months in a cool garage or root cellar. January King (overwintering type with gorgeous purple-green coloring) handles PNW winters beautifully.

**Varieties for PNW:** Early Jersey Wakefield (spring, pointed head, fast), Golden Acre (spring, compact), Ruby Perfection (red, reliable), January King (overwintering, gorgeous and hardy), Danish Ballhead (storage, dense, keeps forever).

**Common mistakes:** Not managing cabbage worms (use row cover!). Splitting from irregular watering. Waiting too long to harvest — overripe cabbage bolts or splits.

## Carrots

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual)  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow March–July (west side); April–June (east side). Succession-sow every 3 weeks.  
**Spacing:** Thin to 2–3 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun to light shade  
**Water:** Consistent moisture; irregular watering causes cracking and forking  
**Days to harvest:** 60–80 days (depending on variety and conditions)

**PNW notes:** Carrots love the PNW's long, cool growing season. They develop sweetness over months that quick-grown summer carrots in hot climates can't match. Fall-harvested carrots that have been through light frosts are candy-sweet.

The key challenge is germination: carrot seeds need consistent moisture for 10–21 days to sprout, and PNW spring weather alternates between helpful rain and crust-forming dry spells. Cover seeded rows with burlap, row cover, or a thin layer of vermiculite to hold moisture. Keep the surface moist until you see sprouts.

Heavy clay requires shorter varieties (Chantenay, Oxheart) or raised beds with loose soil. In well-amended or sandy soil, Nantes types (Bolero, Napoli, Yaya) produce beautiful, cylindrical roots.

**Varieties for PNW:** Napoli (Nantes type, early, sweet), Bolero (Nantes, excellent storage), Nelson (Nantes, refined flavor), Danvers 126 (classic, handles heavier soil), Mokum (early, very sweet), Purple Haze (for fun — purple outside, orange inside).

**Common mistakes:** Not thinning. Letting soil crust over and block germination. Planting in rocky or heavy clay without amending. Pulling too early — carrots keep improving until hard frost.

## Cauliflower

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual)  
**When to plant:** Transplant April–May for spring; transplant July–August for fall.  
**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1.5 inches per week — cauliflower is a water hog  
**Days to harvest:** 55–80 days from transplant

**PNW notes:** Cauliflower is the diva of the brassica family — more temperature-sensitive than broccoli, more demanding about water, and more prone to forming tiny, premature heads ("buttoning") if stressed. Fall is easier than spring for PNW cauliflower — the cooling temperatures and consistent fall moisture suit it better.

Overwintering cauliflower (Walcheren types) is a west-side option: transplant in August, overwinter under minimal protection, and harvest huge heads the following spring.

**Varieties for PNW:** Snow Crown (reliable, fast, good for spring), Graffiti (purple, stunning, and easier than white varieties), Cheddar (orange, fun, less demanding), Amazing (fall, large heads), Galleon (overwintering for west side).

**Common mistakes:** Inconsistent watering. Transplanting at the wrong time — cauliflower is Goldilocks about temperature (60–70°F ideal; too hot or too cold causes buttoning). Forgetting to blanch white varieties by folding leaves over the developing head.

## Garlic

**Type:** Cool-season allium (fall-planted)  
**When to plant:** October (west side); September–October (east side)  
**Spacing:** 6 inches apart, rows 12 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** Consistent moisture in spring; reduce water as leaves start browning in June  
**Days to harvest:** 8–9 months (plant fall, harvest following July)

**PNW notes:** Garlic is the PNW gardener's best friend. Plant cloves in fall, mulch, and ignore them until July. It's ridiculously easy, incredibly satisfying, and saves you real money (a single head of good garlic costs $2–$4 at the farmers market, and one head's worth of cloves plants 8–12 new heads).

**Hardneck vs. softneck:** Hardneck varieties produce scapes (delicious curly flower stalks to harvest in June), have stronger flavor, and handle cold winters. Softneck varieties store longer, produce more cloves per head, and are better for braiding. West-side maritime gardens do well with either type. East-side gardens should lean toward hardneck for cold tolerance.

**Varieties for PNW:** Music (hardneck, large, reliable, the most-planted variety in the PNW), Chesnok Red (hardneck, excellent baking garlic), Inchelium Red (softneck, originated in Washington, outstanding), Nootka Rose (softneck, PNW heritage variety), German Extra Hardy (hardneck, ideal for cold east-side areas), Spanish Roja (hardneck, classic PNW variety from the Portland area).

**Common mistakes:** Planting grocery store garlic (often from China, may carry disease, often wrong type for PNW conditions). Planting too shallow. Not mulching. Harvesting too late — overripe garlic bulbs split and store poorly.

## Kale

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual or perennial in mild climates)  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow or transplant almost any time: March–August for west side; April–July for east side.  
**Spacing:** 18 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun to part shade  
**Water:** 1 inch per week  
**Days to harvest:** 55–65 days to full size; baby leaves in 25 days

**PNW notes:** Kale is the unofficial state vegetable of the Pacific Northwest. It grows year-round west of the Cascades with zero drama. A single planting of Lacinato kale transplanted in April will still be producing in the following February. Frost makes it sweeter. Rain doesn't bother it. Slugs munch the lower leaves, but the plant outgrows them.

**Varieties for PNW:** Lacinato/Dinosaur (Tuscan kale — the best for flavor, texture, and year-round production), Red Russian (tender, beautiful, great raw), Winterbor (curly, extremely cold-hardy, productive), Dwarf Blue Curled (compact, ideal for small spaces and containers).

**Common mistakes:** Not harvesting regularly. Kale produces best when you pick the lower leaves and let the top continue growing. A kale plant you ignore becomes a woody, bitter tree. A kale plant you harvest regularly stays tender and productive for months.

## Lettuce

**Type:** Cool-season annual  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow or transplant March–May for spring; August–September for fall; year-round under protection on the west side.  
**Spacing:** Leaf lettuce: 4–6 inches. Head lettuce: 10–12 inches.  
**Sun:** Full sun in cool seasons; part shade in warm weather  
**Water:** Consistent moisture; drought stress causes bitterness  
**Days to harvest:** 25 days (baby leaf) to 55 days (full head)

**PNW notes:** Lettuce in the PNW is almost embarrassingly easy for 8–9 months of the year. The cool, moist climate is lettuce paradise. Succession-sow every 2–3 weeks from March through May, then again from August through September, for continuous salads.

Summer is the challenge: heat and long days trigger bolting. Use heat-tolerant varieties (Jericho, Muir, Concept) and provide afternoon shade. Or just skip July and enjoy summer without lettuce — fall lettuce is better anyway.

Winter lettuce on the west side is a revelation. Varieties like Winter Density, Winter Marvel, and North Pole hold through mild winters under minimal cover (cold frame or row cover). Harvest outer leaves through January and February, and they'll regrow when day length increases in March.

**Varieties for PNW:** Salanova (one-cut harvest, beautiful), Buttercrunch (butterhead, classic), Red Sails (loose-leaf, bolt-resistant), Jericho (romaine, heat-tolerant), Winter Density (mini romaine, excellent overwintering), Black Seeded Simpson (loose-leaf, easy, fast).

**Common mistakes:** Sowing too thickly. Not succession-sowing. Trying to grow lettuce in midsummer without shade. Not exploring winter lettuce — it's a game-changer for year-round eating.

## Onions

**Type:** Cool-season biennial (grown as annual)  
**When to plant:** From seed: start indoors January–February, transplant April. From sets: plant March–April. Overwintering sets/transplants: August–September.  
**Spacing:** 4–6 inches apart for full-sized bulbs; 2 inches for green onions  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1 inch per week during growth; stop watering when tops begin to fall over  
**Days to harvest:** 90–120 days from transplant (spring-planted); 10+ months (overwintered)

**PNW notes:** The PNW's northern latitude (46–49°N) means you need **long-day onion varieties.** Long-day onions start forming bulbs when day length exceeds 14–16 hours, which happens in June/July at PNW latitudes. Short-day onions (designed for southern states) won't bulb properly here.

**Walla Walla Sweet** is the crown jewel of PNW onions — a giant, mild sweet onion originally brought to Eastern Washington by Italian immigrants. Traditionally planted as seeds in late summer and overwintered for harvest the following July. They're incredible but don't store well — eat them fresh.

For storage onions, choose firm-fleshed varieties: Copra, Patterson, Redwing. These cure well and store for 4–6 months.

**Varieties for PNW:** Walla Walla Sweet (the icon, plant from seed in August for overwintering), Copra (yellow, excellent storage), Redwing (red, good storage), Ailsa Craig (exhibition-size sweet), Candy (hybrid, sweet and productive).

**Common mistakes:** Planting short-day varieties. Starting from seed too late — onions need a long growing season from seed. Not curing properly — spread harvested onions in a warm, dry spot for 2–3 weeks before storage.

## Peas

**Type:** Cool-season annual  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow February–April for spring; August–September for fall (west side).  
**Spacing:** 2–3 inches apart in rows or bands; provide support for climbing types  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1 inch per week; critical during flowering and pod development  
**Days to harvest:** 55–70 days

**PNW notes:** Peas and the PNW are a match made in heaven. Cool temperatures, moderate moisture, and long spring days are exactly what peas want. They're also one of the few crops you can plant in February on the west side, giving you the earliest possible harvest.

Snow peas (Oregon Giant, Oregon Sugar Pod — both bred here) and snap peas (Sugar Snap, Cascadia — also bred in the PNW) give you the most food per plant since you eat the whole pod. Shelling peas (Green Arrow, Lincoln) have superior flavor but lower yield per plant.

Fall peas (planted August, harvested October) are a west-side bonus — the cooling temperatures and gentle rain produce excellent quality, and the plants fix nitrogen for the following season's crops.

**Varieties for PNW:** Cascadia (snap, bred by Dr. Jim Baggett at OSU, compact, incredibly sweet), Sugar Snap (snap, tall, prolific), Oregon Giant (snow, enormous tender pods), Green Arrow (shelling, heavy producer), Lincoln (shelling, superb flavor).

**Common mistakes:** Planting too late — peas hate heat and stop producing above 80°F. Not providing support — even "dwarf" peas climb 2–3 feet and flop without support. Missing the fall planting window for a second crop.

## Potatoes

**Type:** Cool-season tuber  
**When to plant:** March–April (west side); April–May (east side).  
**Spacing:** 12 inches apart in rows 30 inches apart, or 12 inches apart in all directions in beds.  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1–1.5 inches per week; consistent moisture during tuber formation  
**Days to harvest:** 70 days (new potatoes) to 120 days (full-sized storage)

**PNW notes:** Potatoes are one of the easiest and most satisfying crops in the PNW. They tolerate the acidic west-side soil that many vegetables struggle with (potatoes actually prefer pH 5.0–6.0 — don't lime your potato bed!). They produce abundantly, store well, and taste incomparably better than store-bought.

Plant certified seed potatoes (not grocery store potatoes) cut into egg-sized pieces with 2–3 eyes each. Let cut surfaces dry for a day before planting. Plant 4 inches deep and "hill" (mound soil around stems) as plants grow to encourage more tuber formation and prevent greening.

**Early varieties** (Yukon Gold, Red Pontiac, Caribe) are ready in 70–80 days — perfect for new potatoes by July 4th. **Mid-season** (All Blue, Kennebec) need 80–100 days. **Late/storage** (German Butterball, Russet Burbank, Elba) need 100–120 days but store for months.

**Varieties for PNW:** Yukon Gold (all-purpose king), Red Pontiac (early, great boiled), German Butterball (storage, extraordinary flavor), All Blue (fun and nutritious), Kennebec (french fry champion), Russet Burbank (Idaho's contribution — the classic baking potato, developed in the PNW).

**Common mistakes:** Using grocery store potatoes (disease risk, sprout inhibitor). Not hilling. Harvesting too early for storage potatoes — wait until foliage dies completely. Storing potatoes in light — they turn green and toxic.

## Spinach

**Type:** Cool-season annual  
**When to plant:** Direct-sow March–April for spring; August–September for fall; October for overwintering (west side).  
**Spacing:** 4–6 inches apart  
**Sun:** Full sun in cool weather; part shade in warmth  
**Water:** Consistent moisture  
**Days to harvest:** 25 days (baby) to 45 days (full-sized)

**PNW notes:** Spinach is fast, easy, and perfectly suited to PNW springs and falls. True spinach (*Spinacia oleracea*) bolts quickly in warm weather and long days, making it a spring and fall crop only. For summer "spinach," grow New Zealand spinach or Malabar spinach — different plants entirely that tolerate heat.

Overwintered spinach (sown in October on the west side) establishes before winter, goes mostly dormant in December–January, then explodes with growth in February and March — giving you the earliest spring harvest possible.

**Varieties for PNW:** Bloomsdale Long Standing (classic, savoyed leaves, good bolt resistance), Space (smooth-leaved, fast, easy to clean), Corvair (smooth, good for baby leaf), Regiment (excellent fall/winter variety), Giant Winter (overwintering champion).

**Common mistakes:** Sowing too late in spring — spinach planted in May bolts within weeks. Not succession-sowing for continuous harvest. Forgetting the fall/winter planting window, which is actually spinach's best season here.

# Part IV: Mastering the Details

# Chapter 19: Pest & Disease Management

The Pacific Northwest's mild, moist climate is paradise for gardeners — and for the creatures and pathogens that want to eat your garden before you do. The good news: most PNW pest problems are manageable with knowledge, timing, and a few organic tools. The bad news: slugs.

## The Slug Problem

Let's get this out of the way first, because if you garden in the maritime PNW, slugs are your #1 enemy. They're not a nuisance — they're a force of nature.

The European black slug (*Arion ater*), the gray garden slug (*Deroceras reticulatum*), and various other species thrive in the PNW's cool, moist climate. They feed at night, rasp through seedlings, and can destroy a row of lettuce starts overnight.

### Slug Management Strategy

No single method eliminates slugs. Use all of these:

1. **Iron phosphate bait (Sluggo, Sluggo Plus).** The gold standard organic slug killer. Scatter pellets around vulnerable crops. Reapply after rain. Safe around pets and wildlife. Budget $15–$20 for a season's supply per garden.

2. **Evening patrols.** Go out after dark with a headlamp and a container of soapy water. Pick slugs off plants and drop them in. Disgusting? Yes. Effective? Very. Ten minutes of patrol removes dozens of slugs.

3. **Beer traps.** Sink cups or shallow containers into the soil, fill with cheap beer. Slugs crawl in and drown. Replace every few days. Works but doesn't scale well for large gardens.

4. **Barriers.** Copper tape around raised beds creates a mild electric shock that deters slugs. Diatomaceous earth works when dry but washes away in rain (useless west side in winter). Wool pellets (Slug Gone) are a newer option that shows promise.

5. **Habitat reduction.** Slugs hide in debris, boards, thick mulch near stems, and dense ground cover. Keep a clean 6-inch zone around seedlings. Water in the morning so the soil surface is drier at night.

6. **Sacrifice seedlings.** Slugs prefer tender, small plants. Transplant robust starts rather than direct-sowing tiny seedlings for susceptible crops (lettuce, brassicas). Larger plants outgrow slug damage.

> **Pro Tip:** The worst slug damage happens to spring seedlings (March–May) when slug populations are ramping up and plants are small and tender. By midsummer, most crops have outgrown slug damage. Protect transplants with Sluggo and evening patrols for the first 2–3 weeks after planting, and you'll get through the danger zone.

## Common Insect Pests

### Aphids

Tiny soft-bodied insects (green, black, or pink) that cluster on new growth. They suck plant sap and can transmit viruses. They're ubiquitous but rarely fatal.

**Management:** A strong spray from the hose knocks them off. Ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps are natural predators — attract them with flowering herbs (dill, cilantro, yarrow). For serious infestations, insecticidal soap or neem oil. Don't panic — most healthy plants tolerate moderate aphid populations.

### Cabbage Worms / Cabbage Loopers

The green caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly. They chew holes in brassica leaves and hide in broccoli and cauliflower heads.

**Management:** Row cover (Reemay/Agribon) is the best prevention — exclude the butterflies from laying eggs. Install at transplanting time and leave on until harvest. For active infestations, Bt (*Bacillus thuringiensis* var. kurstaki, sold as Dipel or Thuricide) is an organic biological control that kills caterpillars but is safe for other insects, pets, and people.

### Carrot Rust Fly

A small fly whose larvae bore into carrot roots, creating tunnels and brown damage. Common in western PNW.

**Management:** Row cover from seeding through harvest is the most reliable prevention. Delay spring carrot planting until June (after the first generation's egg-laying period). Interplant with onions — the scent may confuse the fly. Harvest fall carrots by late October before the second generation's larvae are active.

### Flea Beetles

Tiny jumping beetles that chew shotgun-pattern holes in leaves of brassicas, eggplant, and other crops. Most damaging to seedlings.

**Management:** Row cover. Kaolin clay spray (Surround) creates a physical barrier on leaves. Healthy, fast-growing plants outgrow flea beetle damage. Most problematic in spring and early summer.

### Cucumber Beetles

Striped or spotted beetles that feed on cucumber, squash, and melon foliage and can transmit bacterial wilt.

**Management:** Row cover until flowering (then remove for pollination). Hand-pick early in the morning when beetles are sluggish. Yellow sticky traps catch some adults. Kaolin clay is a deterrent.

## Common Diseases

### Late Blight (*Phytophthora infestans*)

The PNW's most devastating tomato and potato disease. Cool, wet conditions trigger it, and it can go from first symptoms to dead plants in a week. Symptoms: large, dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems; white fuzzy growth on undersides in humid conditions.

**Management:** Choose resistant varieties (Legend, Defiant, Mountain Magic). Avoid overhead watering. Provide rain covers for tomatoes if possible. Apply copper fungicide preventatively during wet periods. If you see symptoms, remove affected tissue immediately and dispose in trash (not compost). Late blight spores travel miles on wind — you can do everything right and still get it if a neighbor's infected potatoes are upwind.

### Powdery Mildew

White, powdery coating on leaves of squash, cucumbers, peas, and other crops. Common in late summer when warm days and cool nights create ideal conditions.

**Management:** Choose resistant varieties. Ensure good airflow (don't crowd plants). Remove affected leaves. Potassium bicarbonate spray or neem oil can slow progression. Powdery mildew rarely kills plants but reduces yield and quality. Late in the season, it's often not worth fighting — just let the crop finish.

### Downy Mildew

Yellow patches on upper leaf surfaces with gray-purple fuzzy growth underneath. Affects brassicas, lettuce, spinach, and onions. Favored by cool, wet conditions — perfect PNW weather.

**Management:** Good airflow, crop rotation, avoid overhead watering, remove affected plants. Resistant varieties when available. Less controllable than powdery mildew; prevention is key.

### Clubroot

A soil-borne disease of brassicas that causes swollen, deformed roots and stunted plants. Once in the soil, it persists for 10+ years.

**Management:** Maintain soil pH above 7.0 in brassica beds (lime heavily). Rotate brassicas — don't plant in the same spot for 4+ years. Buy disease-free transplants. If you have clubroot, raised beds with fresh soil may be your best option.

## The Integrated Approach

The PNW is an organic gardener's paradise. The biological diversity, mild climate, and strong beneficial insect populations mean that chemical pesticides are rarely needed. Your pest management strategy should follow this hierarchy:

1. **Prevention:** Row covers, resistant varieties, crop rotation, good sanitation
2. **Cultural controls:** Healthy soil, proper spacing, appropriate watering, timing plantings to avoid pest peaks
3. **Biological controls:** Encourage beneficial insects (plant flowers!), use Bt for caterpillars
4. **Organic sprays (last resort):** Insecticidal soap, neem oil, copper fungicide, kaolin clay

Most PNW garden pest problems are solvable without reaching for a spray bottle. Build a healthy ecosystem and let it work.

## Common Mistakes

- **Reaching for sprays first.** Most aphid and flea beetle problems resolve themselves as beneficial insect populations build. Give nature a few weeks before intervening.
- **Not using row cover.** It's the single most effective pest management tool in the PNW. A $15 roll of Agribon-19 protects brassicas from cabbage worms and carrots from rust fly all season.
- **Ignoring slugs until they've destroyed your transplants.** Apply Sluggo preventatively, not reactively. By the time you notice slug damage, they've been feeding for days.
- **Composting diseased plant material.** Home compost piles don't get hot enough to kill late blight, clubroot, or other pathogens. Trash it.

# Chapter 20: Companion Planting & Crop Rotation

## Companion Planting

Companion planting — growing certain crops together for mutual benefit — ranges from well-documented science to garden folklore. Here's what actually works, with PNW-specific notes.

### Proven Combinations

**Brassicas + row cover + dill/cilantro.** The row cover excludes cabbage worms. The flowering herbs (outside the row cover or after it comes off) attract parasitic wasps and hoverflies that eat aphids. This is a system, not a single trick.

**Tomatoes + basil.** Both need warm conditions, so they share the same microclimate. Basil may repel certain pests and is always useful in the kitchen. At minimum, it's an efficient use of your warmest garden real estate.

**Beans + corn + squash (Three Sisters).** The classic polyculture. Corn provides a trellis for pole beans, beans fix nitrogen for all three, and squash shades the ground to suppress weeds and retain moisture. Needs a 10×10-foot minimum area to work properly.

**Alliums + carrots.** The scent of onions and garlic may confuse carrot rust fly. Interplant or border carrot beds with onion family plants. Not foolproof, but helpful as part of an integrated approach.

**Lettuce everywhere.** Tuck lettuce under taller crops (tomatoes, peppers, beans, corn) as a living mulch. It uses space that would otherwise grow weeds, and the shade from taller plants delays lettuce bolting in summer.

### Skip These

**Marigolds repel everything:** Mostly myth. French marigolds do suppress certain soil nematodes if grown densely for a full season — useful in specific situations but not a universal pest repellent. Plant them because they're beautiful, not because they're a miracle.

**Garlic repels everything:** Garlic is a modest insect deterrent at best. It's not a substitute for row cover or other proven methods.

## Crop Rotation

Crop rotation — moving plant families to different beds each year — is one of the most important long-term garden management practices. It prevents disease buildup, breaks pest cycles, and balances soil nutrients.

### The Four-Group Rotation

A simple four-year rotation works well for PNW home gardens:

**Group 1: Solanaceae (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes)**  
Heavy feeders. Add compost and balanced fertilizer. These crops are susceptible to soil-borne diseases (early blight, fusarium, verticillium) that build up with repeated planting.

**Group 2: Brassicaceae (broccoli, cabbage, kale, cauliflower, turnips, radishes)**  
Moderate feeders. Benefit from added lime (west side). Clubroot is the main reason to rotate — once it's in the soil, it persists for a decade+.

**Group 3: Fabaceae + Cucurbitaceae (beans, peas, squash, cucumbers)**  
Beans and peas fix nitrogen, benefiting the following year's crops. Squash and cucumbers are heavy feeders but pair well with legumes.

**Group 4: Apiaceae + Chenopodiaceae + Alliums (carrots, beets, chard, spinach, onions, garlic)**  
Lighter feeders. Benefit from soil improved by the previous year's legumes.

### How It Works in Practice

If you have four raised beds:

| Year | Bed 1 | Bed 2 | Bed 3 | Bed 4 |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2026 | Tomatoes/Peppers | Brassicas | Beans/Squash | Carrots/Beets/Onions |
| 2027 | Brassicas | Beans/Squash | Carrots/Beets/Onions | Tomatoes/Peppers |
| 2028 | Beans/Squash | Carrots/Beets/Onions | Tomatoes/Peppers | Brassicas |
| 2029 | Carrots/Beets/Onions | Tomatoes/Peppers | Brassicas | Beans/Squash |

Each group returns to the same bed every four years. This is the minimum effective rotation. Longer is better if you have space.

### PNW-Specific Rotation Notes

- **Don't follow potatoes with tomatoes** (same family, same diseases). This is the most important rotation rule.
- **Brassicas in the same spot** accelerate clubroot. If you suspect clubroot, extend brassica rotation to 7+ years.
- **Garlic can stay in the same bed** longer than most crops — it's less disease-prone. But rotating every 2–3 years is still best practice.
- **Cover crops count.** A bed resting under cover crop (winter rye, clover) is still part of the rotation — and it's building soil health for the next food crop.

## Common Mistakes

- **No rotation at all.** Growing tomatoes in the same spot every year is asking for disease. Even in raised beds, rotate.
- **Planting related crops together thinking they're different.** Potatoes and tomatoes are the same family. Broccoli and radishes are the same family. Rotation means rotating *families*, not just species.
- **Overthinking companion planting.** Focus on the proven combinations and don't worry about the rest. Rotation matters more.

# Chapter 21: Season Extension Techniques

Season extension is the art of pushing the growing season beyond its natural boundaries — earlier in spring, later in fall, and (in the maritime PNW) straight through winter. The PNW's mild climate makes season extension more effective and more accessible than almost anywhere else in the country.

## Row Cover (Floating Row Cover)

The simplest, cheapest, and most effective season extension tool available.

**What it is:** Lightweight spun-bonded fabric (polypropylene) that lets light, air, and water through while trapping heat and excluding pests. Sold under brand names like Agribon and Reemay in various weights.

**How to use it:** Drape directly over crops (held down with rocks, soil, or landscape staples) or supported on wire hoops for more clearance. Remove for harvesting, then replace.

**Temperature protection:**
- Agribon-19 (lightweight): 4°F of frost protection. Best for pest exclusion and gentle warming.
- Agribon-50 (medium): 6°F of frost protection. Good for fall/winter crop protection.
- Agribon-70 (heavy): 8°F of frost protection. For serious winter production west of the Cascades.

**Cost:** $15–$30 for a 10×25-foot roll. Lasts 2–3 seasons with care.

> **Pro Tip:** Low tunnels — wire hoops covered with row cover — are the PNW winter gardener's best friend. Bend 9-gauge wire into U-shapes over a 3–4 foot wide bed, drape Agribon-50 over top, and clamp with clothespins. This simple structure protects crops to about 20°F and keeps rain from pounding delicate greens into the mud. Cost: under $30 for a 10-foot tunnel.

## Cold Frames

**What it is:** A bottomless box with a transparent lid (glass or polycarbonate), placed over a garden bed to create a mini greenhouse.

**How to use it:** Position against a south-facing wall for maximum heat. Open the lid on sunny days to prevent overheating; close at night for insulation. Use for starting seedlings in spring, hardening off transplants, and protecting fall/winter crops.

**Temperature protection:** 10–15°F of frost protection in a well-built cold frame. In the maritime PNW, a cold frame can keep lettuce, spinach, and mâche growing through the entire winter.

**Cost:** DIY from reclaimed windows and lumber: $20–$50. Commercial cold frames: $100–$300.

## Hoop Houses / High Tunnels

**What it is:** A semi-permanent structure of bent PVC or metal hoops covered in greenhouse plastic (6 mil polyethylene). Larger and taller than low tunnels — walk-in height.

**How to use it:** Extends the growing season on both ends by 4–8 weeks. Keeps rain off crops (huge advantage for tomatoes in the wet PNW). Creates a warm microclimate that benefits warm-season crops all summer and protects cool-season crops all winter.

**Temperature protection:** 10–20°F, depending on construction. In the maritime PNW, an unheated hoop house can keep greens growing year-round and ripen tomatoes 3–4 weeks earlier than outdoor plants.

**Cost:** DIY 10×20-foot hoop house: $200–$500. Commercial kits: $500–$2,000+.

A hoop house is the single best investment for serious PNW vegetable gardeners. The rain protection alone justifies it for tomatoes — no more late blight from wet foliage, no more cracked fruit from sudden September rains.

## Wall-O-Waters and Cloches

**Wall-O-Water:** Circular tepee of water-filled plastic tubes that creates a warm, protected microclimate for individual plants (usually tomatoes). Water absorbs heat during the day and releases it at night, protecting down to 16°F. Essential for early tomato planting west of the Cascades.

**Cloches:** Any clear cover placed over individual plants — glass bell jars, cut plastic bottles, translucent buckets. Simple, free, and effective for a few degrees of frost protection and warmth.

## Black Plastic Mulch

Not technically a structure, but an important season extension tool. Black plastic laid over soil absorbs solar radiation and warms the soil 5–10°F. Use it for 2–4 weeks before transplanting tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and melons. Leave it in place all season as weed suppression and soil warming.

Red (IRT) plastic mulch is specifically designed for tomatoes — it reflects far-red light upward, which studies show increases yield by 12–20%.

## Winter Growing Calendar (West Side)

With season extension, the west side of the PNW can harvest something every month:

| Month | What to Harvest |
|-------|----------------|
| January | Kale, leeks, Brussels sprouts, mâche, claytonia, stored roots |
| February | Same as January; overwintered spinach begins regrowing |
| March | Winter crops + new spring spinach, lettuce, peas |
| April | Spring greens abundant; overwintered crops finishing |
| May | Peas, lettuce, radishes, early beets, spring brassicas |
| June | Peas, lettuce, brassicas, garlic scapes, strawberries |
| July | Beans, cucumbers, summer squash, tomatoes (starting), garlic, potatoes |
| August | Tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, cucumbers, beets, carrots |
| September | Tomatoes (peak), peppers, winter squash, fall lettuce starting |
| October | Fall brassicas, lettuce, root vegetables, last tomatoes |
| November | Brussels sprouts, kale, leeks, fall carrots, winter lettuce |
| December | Kale, leeks, Brussels sprouts, mâche, stored roots |

This is achievable in a backyard garden with modest infrastructure — a few raised beds, row cover, and a cold frame or two. You don't need a greenhouse or commercial setup.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not using row cover.** It's cheap, effective, and multi-purpose (frost protection + pest exclusion). Every PNW gardener should own at least one roll.
- **Overheating under cover.** A closed cold frame or hoop house in full sun can hit 100°F+ on a sunny spring day. Ventilate! Open lids and roll up sides when temperatures rise above 75°F.
- **Skipping black plastic mulch for warm-season crops.** West of the Cascades, soil temperature is the limiting factor for tomatoes and peppers. Pre-warming with black plastic is free season extension.
- **Thinking season extension requires expensive equipment.** A $15 roll of row cover and some wire hoops provide more season extension than most gardeners will ever need.

## Glossary

Because every hobby has its jargon, and gardening has more than most. Here's a quick decoder ring:

**Amendments** — Materials added to soil to improve its structure, fertility, or drainage. Compost, lime, sulfur, and perlite are all amendments. Think of them as soil vitamins.

**Annual** — A plant that completes its life cycle (germination to seed production to death) in one growing season. Tomatoes, beans, and zucchini are annuals. They live fast and die young.

**Biennial** — A plant that takes two years to complete its life cycle. Carrots, beets, parsley, and kale are technically biennials — they grow leaves the first year, then flower and produce seed the second year. We usually eat them before they get the chance.

**Bolting** — When a plant prematurely sends up a flower stalk, usually in response to heat or long days. Lettuce bolts, spinach bolts, cilantro bolts with extreme prejudice. Once a plant bolts, the leaves usually turn bitter. It's the plant's way of saying, "I'm done feeding you; I'm making babies now."

**Brassica** — The mustard family (Brassicaceae), including broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, turnips, and radishes. If it smells vaguely sulfurous when you cook it, it's probably a brassica. Also known as "cole crops" or "cruciferous vegetables."

**Cloche** — A protective cover placed over individual plants, traditionally bell-shaped glass, now usually a plastic jug with the bottom cut off or a Wall O' Water. The French word means "bell," and using it makes you sound approximately 30% more sophisticated at garden parties.

**Cold Frame** — A bottomless box with a transparent lid (often an old window) used to protect plants from cold and wind. Think of it as a miniature greenhouse for plants that didn't make varsity.

**Cold Stratification** — Exposing seeds to a period of cold (usually refrigerator temperature, 33–40°F) to break dormancy. Many native plants and perennial herbs require this. Nature does it automatically; we sometimes need to simulate it for seeds started indoors.

**Compost** — Decomposed organic matter. The black gold of the garden world. If gardening had a currency, this would be it. Made from kitchen scraps, yard waste, and patience.

**Cover Crop** — A crop grown not for harvest but to protect and improve the soil. Crimson clover, winter rye, and fava beans are common PNW cover crops. They're the garden equivalent of a placeholder — keeping the soil busy until you're ready to plant something you actually want to eat.

**Cross-Pollination** — When pollen from one plant variety fertilizes the flowers of another variety. Important mainly for seed savers; won't affect this year's harvest but can produce surprising offspring next generation.

**Damping Off** — A fungal disease that kills seedlings at the soil line, causing them to flop over like tiny fainting goats. Caused by overly wet conditions and poor air circulation. Prevention: don't overwater your seedlings, and aim a small fan at them.

**Days to Maturity (DTM)** — The number of days from planting (or transplanting) to first harvest. A critical number for PNW gardeners because our growing season has a hard expiration date. When a seed packet says "75 days," that means 75 days under ideal conditions — add a week or two for our cool springs.

**Determinate** — A tomato growth habit where the plant reaches a set size, produces most of its fruit at once, and then slows down. Good for canning. Contrast with indeterminate, which grows and produces until frost kills it.

**Direct Sow** — Planting seeds directly into the garden soil rather than starting them in pots indoors. Beans, peas, carrots, and radishes prefer direct sowing. Root crops generally hate being transplanted.

**Drip Line** — (1) The outer edge of a tree's canopy, where rain drips off leaves. (2) An irrigation system that delivers water slowly at soil level through perforated tubing. Both definitions are useful; context will tell you which.

**F1 Hybrid** — The first-generation offspring of two distinct parent varieties, bred for specific traits like disease resistance, uniformity, or productivity. Seeds saved from F1 hybrids won't "come true" (produce identical plants), so you'll need to buy new seed each year. Think of them as the mules of the plant world — excellent workers, but their kids will be unpredictable.

**Floating Row Cover** — Lightweight, spun-bonded fabric draped over plants to protect against frost, wind, and insects while allowing light, air, and water through. Agribon, Reemay, and Typar are brand names. Every PNW gardener should own at least one roll.

**Frost Date (Last/First)** — The average date of the last spring frost and first fall frost for your area. These define your outdoor growing season. "Average" is the key word — Mother Nature did not read the USDA charts.

**Green Manure** — Another term for cover crops, especially when they're tilled or chopped into the soil to decompose and add organic matter. It's manure in the sense that it feeds the soil, but it's green and doesn't smell like a barn.

**Hardening Off** — The process of gradually acclimating indoor-grown seedlings to outdoor conditions over 7–10 days. Start with a few hours of sheltered outdoor exposure, increasing daily. Skip this step and your seedlings will react to full sun and wind like a vampire at a beach party.

**Heirloom** — An open-pollinated variety that has been passed down through generations (generally 50+ years old). Brandywine tomatoes, Lacinato kale, and Scarlet Runner beans are heirlooms. They have stories, character, and often better flavor than modern hybrids — though sometimes less disease resistance.

**Hill Planting** — Sowing several seeds in a raised mound of soil. Used for squash, cucumbers, and melons. The mound warms faster and drains better. Not actually a hill so much as a slightly elevated circle.

**Hoop House** — An unheated greenhouse made from arched metal or PVC hoops covered in polyethylene plastic. Bigger than a cold frame, smaller than a commercial greenhouse, and the single best investment a serious PNW gardener can make.

**Indeterminate** — A tomato growth habit where the plant keeps growing, flowering, and fruiting until killed by frost. Needs staking or caging. Most PNW-favorite tomatoes (Stupice, Sungold, Early Girl) are indeterminate.

**Interplanting** — Growing two or more crops in the same space simultaneously. Radishes between rows of slow-growing carrots. Lettuce in the shade of tomato cages. It's efficiency and companion planting rolled into one.

**Inoculant** — A powder or liquid containing beneficial bacteria (Rhizobium) applied to legume seeds before planting. Helps peas and beans fix nitrogen from the air into the soil. Cheap and genuinely useful, especially in new garden beds.

**Microclimate** — A small area where the climate differs from the surrounding area. A south-facing brick wall, a sheltered courtyard, a low frost pocket — these are all microclimates. Learning your yard's microclimates is the superpower of PNW gardening.

**Mulch** — Material spread on the soil surface to retain moisture, suppress weeds, moderate soil temperature, and look tidy. Straw, leaves, wood chips, and compost are common organic mulches. Think of it as a blanket for your soil — tuck it in and let the worms do their thing underneath.

**N-P-K** — The three numbers on fertilizer labels, representing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). A label reading "10-10-10" means 10% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus, 10% potassium by weight. Nitrogen for leaves, phosphorus for roots and fruits, potassium for overall health. The gardener's three-letter mantra.

**Open-Pollinated (OP)** — A variety that reproduces true to type from saved seed (as long as it's not cross-pollinated by a different variety). All heirlooms are open-pollinated, but not all open-pollinated varieties are old enough to be called heirlooms.

**Perennial** — A plant that lives for more than two years. Asparagus, rhubarb, and most herbs (rosemary, thyme, oregano) are perennials. Plant once, harvest for years. The lazy gardener's best friend.

**pH** — A measure of soil acidity or alkalinity on a scale of 0–14, with 7.0 being neutral. Most vegetables prefer 6.0–7.0. PNW soils tend to be acidic (below 7.0), which is why we lime. Blueberries are the notable exception — they love our naturally acidic soil.

**Pollination** — The transfer of pollen from male to female flower parts, enabling fruit and seed production. Done by bees, wind, or your paintbrush (for greenhouse tomatoes). No pollination = no fruit, which is why we should all be very nice to bees.

**Raised Bed** — A garden bed built above the existing ground level, usually framed with wood, stone, or metal. Excellent for PNW gardens because they warm faster, drain better, and save your back. The most popular dimensions are 4 feet wide (you can reach the center from either side) by 8 feet long.

**Row Cover** — See Floating Row Cover. Same thing, shorter name.

**Seed Starting Mix** — A lightweight, sterile growing medium used to germinate seeds indoors. Typically peat moss or coir, perlite, and vermiculite. NOT the same as potting soil, which is too heavy for tiny seedlings. Using garden soil to start seeds indoors is a recipe for damping off and despair.

**Side-Dressing** — Applying fertilizer alongside growing plants, usually in a shallow trench or sprinkled around the drip line. A mid-season boost for heavy feeders like corn and tomatoes. Think of it as a snack between meals.

**Soil Test** — A laboratory analysis of your soil's pH, nutrient levels, and organic matter content. Costs $15–30 through your extension service and is the single smartest thing you can do before starting a garden. Guessing at soil amendments is like cooking without tasting — you might get lucky, but probably not.

**Succession Planting** — Planting the same crop at intervals (every 2–3 weeks) for a continuous harvest rather than one overwhelming glut. Essential for lettuce, beans, and radishes. Nobody needs forty heads of lettuce ready on the same Tuesday.

**Thinning** — Removing excess seedlings so the remaining plants have room to grow. Emotionally difficult but absolutely necessary. Those crowded carrot seedlings will produce nothing but miserable, twisted pencils if you don't thin them. Be brave.

**Transplant** — (1) A seedling grown indoors and moved to the garden. (2) The act of moving said seedling. Handle with care — they've lived their whole lives in a cozy indoor pot, and the outside world is a shock.

**Variety** — A specific cultivated type within a species. 'Brandywine,' 'Cherokee Purple,' and 'Sungold' are all varieties (or cultivars) of tomato. Choosing the right variety for the PNW is at least half the battle.

**Vernalization** — Exposure to a prolonged period of cold that triggers a plant to flower. Onions, garlic, and biennials require vernalization. Our PNW winters handle this nicely.

**Zone (USDA Hardiness Zone)** — A geographic area defined by its average annual minimum temperature. Used primarily for perennials, trees, and shrubs to determine winter survivability. Western Washington is mostly zones 8a–8b; eastern areas range from 5b–7a. Helpful but doesn't tell the whole story — our cool summers matter as much as our mild winters.

## PNW Vegetable Variety Hall of Fame

Because variety selection is half the battle in our climate, here are the varieties that have proven themselves over decades in PNW gardens. These aren't the only options — they're the ones we'd grab if we could only pick a few:

### Tomatoes
- **Stupice** — Czech heirloom. Early, productive, good flavor. The "boring reliable friend" of PNW tomatoes, and we mean that as the highest compliment.
- **Sungold** — Cherry tomato. Ridiculously sweet, ridiculously productive. Will take over your garden and your heart.
- **Early Girl** — Hybrid. Early and reliable. Not the most exciting flavor, but she shows up on time, every time.
- **Legend** — Oregon State University release. Determinate, disease-resistant, early. Bred specifically for the PNW. Respectable flavor.
- **Black Krim** — For the gambler. Deep, complex flavor when it ripens, which it does about 60% of PNW summers. Worth the risk.
- **Glacier** — Extremely early determinate. Small fruits, decent flavor, practically frost-proof. Your insurance policy.
- **Siletz** — Another OSU release. Determinate, early, and sets fruit in cool weather. Named after the Oregon coast. If a tomato can fruit at the coast, it can fruit anywhere.

### Beans
- **Provider** — Bush bean. Germinates in cool soil when others won't. Reliable as sunrise.
- **Kentucky Wonder** — Pole bean. Classic flavor, massive production. Give it something tall to climb.
- **Dragon Tongue** — Beautiful cream-and-purple pods. Good fresh or dried.
- **Scarlet Runner** — Technically perennial in mild PNW winters. Gorgeous flowers, great beans, fixes nitrogen. Triple threat.

### Peas
- **Oregon Sugar Pod II** — Snow pea. Bred here, thrives here. End of discussion.
- **Cascadia** — Snap pea. Developed at WSU. Disease-resistant and sweet.
- **Green Arrow** — Shelling pea. Compact vines, big yields. A PNW classic.

### Brassicas
- **Lacinato Kale** (aka Dinosaur Kale) — Superior flavor, beautiful form. Better in the garden and on the plate than curly kale. Fight me.
- **Red Russian Kale** — Tender, sweet, gorgeous. Less tough-stemmed than Lacinato.
- **Waltham 29 Broccoli** — Open-pollinated, cold-tolerant, produces side shoots for weeks after the main head is cut.
- **January King Cabbage** — Cold-hardy, beautiful purple-green heads, excellent for overwinter harvests.

### Lettuce
- **Winter Density** — A romaine/butterhead cross that handles cold. Overwinters under cover.
- **Red Sails** — Fast-growing, bolt-resistant, handsome in the garden.
- **Black Seeded Simpson** — The "basic" lettuce. Heat-tolerant (for a lettuce), fast, reliable.

### Root Vegetables
- **Nantes-type Carrots** (Napoli, Bolero, Yaya) — Sweet, blunt-tipped, less finicky about soil than Imperator types. Bolero in particular stores like a champ.
- **Chioggia Beet** — Candy-striped interior. Same great flavor as any beet, but infinitely more Instagram-worthy.
- **Purple Top White Globe Turnip** — The classic. Fast-growing, mild flavor, stores well.
- **Yukon Gold Potato** — Buttery flesh, good disease resistance, and it's *Canadian* — practically a PNW native.

### Squash
- **Delicata** — Winter squash that matures in short seasons. Edible skin. Sweet, nutty flavor. The gateway drug for winter squash skeptics.
- **Butternut (Waltham)** — Needs a longer season but worth growing against a south-facing wall.
- **Zucchini (Black Beauty or Costata Romanesco)** — Because every garden needs a zucchini, and every gardener needs the August panic of "what do I do with all this zucchini?"

### Garlic
- **Music** — Hard-neck. Large cloves, strong flavor, stores well. A PNW staple.
- **Inchelium Red** — Soft-neck from the Colville reservation in Washington. Mild, complex flavor. Stores for months.
- **Chesnok Red** — Hard-neck. The roasting garlic. Creamy and sweet when roasted, with enough flavor to remind you it's still garlic.

## Unit Conversions & Quick Math

Because gardening involves more math than anyone expects, and nobody wants to do long division while holding a trowel.

| What You Need | The Math |
|---------------|----------|
| Bed square footage | Length (ft) × Width (ft) |
| Cubic feet of soil for raised bed | L × W × Depth (all in feet) |
| Cubic yards of soil from cubic feet | Cubic feet ÷ 27 |
| Row feet per pound of seed | Check seed packet; varies widely |
| Fertilizer per 100 sq ft | Follow soil test recommendations |
| Gallons per cubic foot | 1 cubic foot ≈ 7.48 gallons |
| 1 inch of rain on 100 sq ft | ≈ 62 gallons |
| Pounds of compost per cubic yard | ≈ 800–1,000 lbs (varies by moisture) |

**Common raised bed fill amounts:**
- 4×4×1 foot bed = 16 cubic feet (0.6 cubic yards)
- 4×8×1 foot bed = 32 cubic feet (1.2 cubic yards)
- 4×8×2 foot bed = 64 cubic feet (2.4 cubic yards)

**Soil temperature for germination (minimum):**
- Peas, spinach, lettuce: 35–40°F
- Carrots, beets, radishes: 40–45°F
- Beans, corn: 60°F
- Squash, cucumbers, melons: 65°F
- Peppers: 65–70°F

# Closing Remarks: The PNW Gardening Life

If you've made it this far — through the soil science, the slug battles, the careful dance of starting tomatoes indoors while rain hammers your windows — then you're ready. More than ready. You've got the knowledge. Now you just need the dirt under your fingernails.

Here's what I want you to remember as you head out to your garden:

**Perfection is not the goal.** The goal is food. The goal is the deeply weird satisfaction of eating a salad that was, an hour ago, still growing in your backyard. The goal is handing a neighbor a bag of green beans and watching their face light up. The goal is teaching a kid where carrots come from (the ground, not the bag) and watching their mind explode.

**You will fail at some things.** Your brassicas will get clubroot. Your lettuce will bolt. Something — deer, slugs, raccoons, the neighbor's cat — will eat your strawberries the night before you planned to pick them. This is gardening. It has been this way for ten thousand years. The difference between a frustrated gardener and a happy one is not fewer failures; it's a shorter memory and a longer planting list.

**The PNW is one of the great gardening regions on Earth.** I mean that sincerely. Our mild winters, moderate summers, and abundant rainfall give us a twelve-month growing season if we choose to use it. We can grow crops that California gardeners envy (brassicas, root vegetables, overwintering greens) and crops that Midwestern gardeners can't even attempt without a greenhouse (year-round lettuce, overwintering fava beans). We complain about the rain, but the rain is our superpower. Learn to work with it instead of cursing it, and you'll never look at a gray sky the same way again.

**Keep notes.** I cannot stress this enough. Write down what you planted, when you planted it, where it went, and what happened. Was it a good year for tomatoes? Write it down. Did the slugs annihilate your starts in May? Write it down. Was there a weird warm spell in February that tricked your fruit trees into blooming early? Write it down. In five years, those notes will be worth more than every gardening book on your shelf — including this one.

**Share what you grow.** Vegetables are generous, and so should we be. Give away your extra zucchini (lord knows you'll have extra zucchini). Trade tomatoes for eggs with your neighbor who keeps chickens. Bring herbs to the potluck. Drop off a bag of kale at your friend's doorstep with no warning or explanation — just kale, a note that says "from my garden," and the quiet satisfaction of being a person who grows things and gives them away.

**Talk to other gardeners.** Every PNW gardener has hard-won wisdom about their specific slice of this complicated climate. The retired teacher down the street who's been growing tomatoes for forty years? She knows things about your microclimate that no book can tell you. The guy at the farmers' market who grows those perfect carrots? Ask him how. Gardeners love talking about gardening. We literally cannot help ourselves.

And finally: **go outside and start.** Not tomorrow. Not when you've finished reading one more chapter of one more book. Not when you've built the perfect raised bed or bought the ideal soil mix or found the exact right variety of tomato. Today. This weekend. Take whatever space you have — a sunny patch of yard, a half-barrel on a balcony, a community garden plot — and put a seed in the ground.

The rain will do the rest. It always does.

Welcome to PNW vegetable gardening. Your hands are about to get dirty, your fridge is about to get full, and your relationship with August is about to get a whole lot more interesting.

Now go grow something.
