- No Kindle-optimized versions (traditional print publishing model)
- No Northern California standalone
- No Texas standalone (lumped into "Southwest" with AZ/NM)
- No Florida standalone (lumped into "Southeast" with 12 other states)
- No companion digital resources (planting calendars, apps, etc.)
- Pricing: $20+ paperback, not competitive in ebook market

## Other Regional Competitors

### Cool Springs Press / Quarto "Fruit & Vegetable Gardening Guides" Series
- **Texas Fruit & Vegetable Gardening** — Greg Grant (2nd ed.) — $18–22 paperback
- State-specific series covering many states
- More recent editions but general (fruits + vegetables combined)
- Less depth on vegetable-specific techniques

### State-Specific Books
- **Texas Organic Vegetable Gardening** — J. Howard Garrett — older, still selling
- **Neil Sperry's Complete Guide to Texas Gardening** — dated but iconic
- **Central Texas Vegetable Garden Planner** — KDP self-published, journal format

### KDP Self-Published
- Flood of low-quality "zone X gardening" books
- Most are 50–80 pages, $9.99–$14.99
- Poor reviews, AI-generated content suspicions
- **This is actually an opportunity** — quality gap is enormous

## Gap Analysis

### Regions Timber Press Does NOT Cover (or covers poorly)

| Gap | Opportunity | Market Size | Priority |
|-----|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Texas (standalone)** | 30M people, zones 7–10, massive gardening interest | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | #1 |
| **Florida (standalone)** | 22M people, zones 8–11, year-round growing | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | #2 |
| **Northern California** | Distinct from SoCal, wine country, zones 7–10 | 🔥🔥🔥 | #5 |
| **Great Plains / Prairie** | KS, NE, OK, Dakotas — extreme climate challenges | 🔥🔥 | #8 |
| **Hawaii** | Unique tropical, niche but underserved | 🔥 | #10 |

### Regions Where Timber Press is OUTDATED (10+ years, climate shift)

| Region | Why It's Outdated | Our Angle |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Southeast** | Zone shifts, new cultivars, updated pest/disease info | Updated for 2026 USDA zones |
| **Southwest** | Extreme drought changes, water restrictions | Water-smart focus |
| **Midwest** | Longer growing seasons, new zone boundaries | Climate-adapted techniques |
| **Pacific Northwest** | Wildfire smoke, heat domes, drought | Resilience-focused update |

### Key Differentiators for Harvest Home Guides
1. **Ebook-first** — Kindle-optimized, lower price point ($9.99–$12.99)
2. **Updated for 2026 USDA Hardiness Zones** — major selling point
3. **Narrower regional focus** — Texas, not "Southwest." Florida, not "Southeast."
4. **Month-by-month PLUS week-by-week planting calendars** by sub-region
5. **QR codes** linking to companion online resources
6. **Climate-resilient techniques** — drought, heat, extreme weather
7. **Container & small-space sections** — urban gardener market
8. **Beginner-friendly** with advanced techniques for experienced growers

## Price Point Analysis

| Format | Timber Press | Cool Springs | KDP Low-Quality | **Our Target** |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Paperback | $19–25 | $18–22 | $12–15 | **$14.99** |
| Kindle | $14–18 | $12–16 | $4.99–9.99 | **$9.99** |
| Kindle Unlimited | No | No | Yes (some) | **Yes** |

**Strategy:** Undercut Timber Press on price while dramatically exceeding KDP self-pub quality. $9.99 Kindle is the sweet spot — premium enough to signal quality, accessible enough for impulse buys.
