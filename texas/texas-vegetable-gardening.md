# Part I: Getting Started in Texas

# Chapter 1: Why Texas Is Different

You moved to Texas — or maybe you've been here your whole life — and you want to grow vegetables. Good news: Texas is one of the best places in the country to garden. Bad news: it's also one of the trickiest. We've got 268,000 square miles of wildly different climates, soils, and growing conditions, and advice that works perfectly in Houston will straight-up kill your garden in El Paso.

That's why this book exists. Not to give you generic gardening advice with a cowboy hat on it, but to tell you exactly what to plant, when to plant it, and how to keep it alive — based on where you actually live in this enormous state.

## Texas's Six Growing Regions

Texas is too big for one-size-fits-all gardening. Throughout this book, we'll reference six distinct growing regions. Find yours and memorize it — every planting date, variety recommendation, and watering schedule in this book is keyed to these regions.

### North Texas / DFW (USDA Zones 7b–8a)

**Last spring frost:** March 15–25  
**First fall frost:** November 5–15

North Texas gives you a solid spring season and a generous fall window, but summers are punishing — expect 25+ days above 100°F in a typical year. The Blackland Prairie soil is legendary for its fertility and equally legendary for its ability to crack open wide enough to lose a shoe in during drought. Clay is the dominant soil type here, and learning to work with it (not against it) is your first job.

The DFW metroplex area benefits from the urban heat island effect, which can push your frost dates a week or two later in fall and earlier in spring compared to surrounding rural areas.

### Central Texas / Hill Country (Zones 8a–8b)

**Last spring frost:** March 1–15  
**First fall frost:** November 15–25

Austin, San Antonio, and the Hill Country corridor offer one of Texas's best growing seasons — if you can figure out the soil. Central Texas sits on limestone bedrock, and your "soil" might be better described as caliche rock with a thin layer of optimism on top. Raised beds aren't optional here; they're survival equipment.

The upside? A long fall season, mild winters that allow year-round greens, and enough heat to ripen peppers that would make a jalapeño nervous.

### Gulf Coast / Houston (Zone 9a)

**Last spring frost:** February 15–28  
**First fall frost:** December 1–15

The Gulf Coast region is Texas's tropical edge. You get a massive growing season — sometimes 300+ frost-free days — but you also get humidity that breeds fungal diseases like a science experiment. Sandy, acidic soils are common, which is actually a nice break from the clay and caliche elsewhere in the state.

Hurricane season (June through November) is a real consideration for garden planning. A single storm can deliver 10+ inches of rain in a day, so drainage is critical.

### South Texas / Rio Grande Valley (Zones 9b–10a)

**Last spring frost:** January 15–February 1 (if you get one at all)  
**First fall frost:** December 15–January 1

The Valley is practically subtropical. You can grow citrus, avocados, and vegetables that gardeners in Dallas can only dream about. Your biggest challenge isn't cold — it's the blistering summer heat that starts in May and doesn't let up until October.

Many Valley gardeners essentially reverse the national calendar: growing most vegetables in the "winter" months (October through March) and treating summer as the dormant season.

### West Texas / El Paso (Zones 7b–8a)

**Last spring frost:** March 20–April 5  
**First fall frost:** October 25–November 10

West Texas is a different planet from the rest of the state. You've got the same zone numbers as DFW but completely different conditions — arid desert with single-digit humidity, alkaline soil, intense UV, and wind that can sandblast the leaves off a young transplant. Annual rainfall? Maybe 8–12 inches. Houston gets that in a good weekend.

The saving grace is low humidity, which means fewer fungal diseases, and dramatic day-to-night temperature swings that help tomatoes and peppers set fruit. Water is your limiting factor — everything else is solvable.

### East Texas / Piney Woods (Zones 8a–8b)

**Last spring frost:** March 5–20  
**First fall frost:** November 10–25

East Texas is the lush, green surprise of the state. Sandy, acidic soils, 45–55 inches of annual rainfall, and pine forests create conditions more like the Deep South than the stereotypical Texas landscape. Blueberries love it here. So do sweet potatoes, southern peas, and just about anything that appreciates regular moisture.

Your challenges are different from the rest of Texas: more fungal pressure from humidity, acidic soil that needs lime for most vegetables, and dense shade from those gorgeous pine trees.

## The 2026 USDA Hardiness Zone Map

The USDA updated its Plant Hardiness Zone Map, and several areas of Texas shifted half a zone warmer. This reflects 30 years of temperature data and what Texas gardeners have been noticing for a while: winters are milder than they used to be.

What this means practically:

- **Your last frost date may be earlier** than the traditional guidelines suggest
- **Your first frost date may be later**, extending the fall season
- **Subtropical plants** are viable further north than before
- **Don't get cocky.** A freak freeze can still hit any part of Texas. February 2021 taught us all that lesson.

Use the frost dates in this book as guidelines, not guarantees. Keep row covers handy, watch your local forecast, and never bet the whole garden on one planting date.

## Two Growing Seasons: The Texas Advantage

Here's the thing that makes Texas gardening genuinely special: you get two full growing seasons. Most of the country gets one shot — spring through fall, done. In Texas, we get a spring season AND a fall season, and honestly, fall is often better.

**Spring season** (February through May/June): Plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, squash, and beans. Race against the summer heat to get harvests before temperatures shut everything down.

**Fall season** (August through December): Plant a second round of warm-season crops PLUS cool-season favorites like broccoli, kale, and lettuce. Cooler temps, fewer pests, and more reliable rainfall make fall gardening almost effortless compared to spring.

**The dead zone** (July through mid-August): The period where smart Texas gardeners take a break, water what's surviving, and start planning (and planting!) the fall garden indoors.

## The Texas Summer: Managing the Dead Zone

Let's talk about July and August, because if you've never gardened through a Texas summer, you need to know what's coming.

When daytime highs stay above 95°F and nighttime temps don't drop below 75°F, most vegetables stop producing. Tomatoes won't set fruit. Squash gives up. Beans drop their blossoms. Even peppers — those heat-loving overachievers — start to struggle above 95°F.

This isn't failure. This is Texas. The dead zone is when you:

1. Maintain what's still producing (okra, sweet potatoes, some peppers)
2. Solarize empty beds to kill weeds and pathogens
3. Start fall transplants indoors under lights
4. Order seeds for the fall garden
5. Rest. Seriously. Hydrate. Stay inside during the worst of it.

We'll cover specific dead-zone strategies in Chapters 10 and 11.

## Average First and Last Frost Dates by Region

| Region | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Frost-Free Days |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| North Texas / DFW | March 15–25 | November 5–15 | 225–240 |
| Central Texas | March 1–15 | November 15–25 | 245–265 |
| Gulf Coast | February 15–28 | December 1–15 | 275–300 |
| South Texas / RGV | January 15–Feb 1 | December 15–Jan 1 | 320–350 |
| West Texas / El Paso | March 20–April 5 | October 25–Nov 10 | 200–225 |
| East Texas | March 5–20 | November 10–25 | 235–260 |

These are averages based on the most recent 30-year climate data. Your specific microclimate — urban vs. rural, hilltop vs. valley, north-facing vs. south-facing — can shift these dates by a week or two in either direction.

> **Pro Tip:** Your county's Texas A&M AgriLife Extension office publishes frost date data specific to your area. Google "[your county] Texas AgriLife Extension" for the most localized information available. These folks are free, they're local, and they know their stuff.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using generic national planting guides.** A planting calendar designed for Zone 8 in Georgia won't work for Zone 8 in Texas. Same number, completely different conditions.
- **Ignoring the fall season.** Many new Texas gardeners only plant in spring. You're leaving half your potential harvest on the table.
- **Planting too late in spring.** The race is against heat, not cold. If you wait until "it feels warm enough" to plant tomatoes, you've already lost three weeks.
- **Treating all of Texas the same.** Your neighbor's cousin in San Antonio has different planting dates than you do in Amarillo. Trust your region's calendar, not Facebook advice.

# Chapter 2: Understanding Texas Soil

You can have perfect seeds, flawless timing, and a watering system designed by NASA — but if your soil is wrong, nothing will grow right. And Texas soil? It's... memorable.

Every region has its own soil personality, from the black clay of the Blackland Prairie that will suck the boots right off your feet when it's wet, to the caliche of Central Texas that might as well be a parking lot. Understanding what you're working with is the first step to growing anything successfully.

## Soil Types Across Texas

### Blackland Prairie Clay (North Texas, parts of Central Texas)

The good: this dark, heavy clay is extremely fertile. It holds nutrients like a savings account.

The bad: it holds water the same way. When it's wet, it's sticky, dense, and unworkable. When it's dry, it cracks into canyons wide enough to snap a carrot root. The pH runs alkaline, typically 7.5–8.2.

**Working with it:** Never work clay soil when it's wet — you'll create concrete bricks. Add 3–4 inches of compost annually. Gypsum can help break up clay structure (apply 40 lbs per 1,000 square feet). Raised beds are your friend here, especially if you fill them with a custom soil mix.

### Sandy Loam (East Texas, parts of Gulf Coast)

Sandy loam is the soil most gardeners wish they had. It drains well, warms up quickly in spring, and is easy to work. East Texas soils tend to be acidic (pH 5.5–6.5), which is actually close to ideal for most vegetables.

**Working with it:** The downside of sandy soil is it doesn't hold water or nutrients well. Add compost generously — 4+ inches per year. Mulch heavily. You'll need to fertilize more frequently because nutrients leach through sand faster than clay.

### Caliche and Limestone (Central Texas, Hill Country, parts of West Texas)

Caliche is a layer of calcium carbonate — basically natural concrete — that sits anywhere from 6 inches to several feet below the surface. Above it, you might have a few inches of rocky, alkaline soil (pH 7.8–8.5) that laughs at your rototiller.

**Working with it:** Don't fight the caliche. Build on top of it. Raised beds 12–18 inches deep, filled with quality garden soil, are the standard approach in Central Texas. If you must garden in-ground, a pickaxe and a lot of determination can break through thinner caliche layers, but there's no shame in going raised.

### Sandy Soil (Gulf Coast, South Texas)

Coastal and South Texas soils range from deep sand to sandy clay. They're often low in organic matter and can be either acidic (closer to the coast) or alkaline (further inland).

**Working with it:** Sand drains fast — sometimes too fast. Build up organic matter with compost, composted manure, and cover crops. Mulch is essential to slow evaporation. The bright side: sandy soil warms up early, giving you a head start on the season.

### Alkaline Desert Soil (West Texas)

West Texas soil is alkaline (pH 7.8–8.5+), low in organic matter, and often compacted. It can contain high levels of salts, especially in areas with limited rainfall to flush them through.

**Working with it:** Amend with sulfur to lower pH if needed (4–5 lbs per 100 square feet for a modest adjustment). Add copious organic matter. Raised beds with imported soil are, again, the path of least resistance. Drip irrigation helps prevent salt buildup at the soil surface.

## Soil Testing: How, Where, and What the Numbers Mean

Before you amend anything, test your soil. This isn't optional — it's the difference between solving the right problem and throwing money at the wrong one.

**How to test:**

1. Collect samples from 6–8 spots in your garden area
2. Dig down 6 inches at each spot
3. Mix all samples together in a clean bucket
4. Let the mix air-dry
5. Bag about 2 cups of the dried soil

**Where to send it:**

- **Texas A&M Soil Testing Lab** — About $12 for the basic test. Turnaround is 7–10 business days. They'll give you specific amendment recommendations for Texas conditions. This is the gold standard.
- **Your local county Extension office** can help you interpret results.
- **Home test kits** (Luster Leaf, etc.) give rough readings but lack the precision of a lab test. Fine for a quick check, not a substitute for a real analysis.

**What the numbers mean:**

- **pH:** Most vegetables prefer 6.0–7.0. Texas soils often run 7.5–8.5 (alkaline). Below 6.0 (common in East Texas), you'll need lime.
- **Nitrogen (N):** Fuels leaf growth. Most Texas soils need supplemental nitrogen.
- **Phosphorus (P):** Supports root development and fruiting. Many Texas soils have adequate phosphorus.
- **Potassium (K):** Overall plant health. Usually adequate in Texas clay soils, sometimes low in sandy soils.
- **Organic matter:** The magic ingredient. Most Texas soils are below 2%. You want 4–5%.
- **Micronutrients:** Iron deficiency is common in alkaline soils (shows up as yellowing between leaf veins). Zinc can be low in sandy soils.

> **Pro Tip:** Test your soil every 2–3 years, and always test a new garden area before planting. A $12 soil test can save you $200 in wrong amendments and a season of frustration.

## Amending Clay Soil Without Losing Your Mind

If you garden in North Texas or the Blackland Prairie, you're gardening in clay. Here's how to make it work:

**Year 1: The Big Push**
1. Spread 4–6 inches of quality compost over the bed
2. Apply gypsum at 40 lbs per 1,000 sq ft
3. Work it into the top 8–10 inches (use a broadfork if you're strong, a rototiller if you're practical)
4. Add 2–3 inches of mulch on top

**Year 2 and Beyond: Maintenance**
1. Add 2–3 inches of compost each spring and fall
2. Never walk on garden beds (compaction is clay's worst enemy)
3. Mulch continuously
4. Let earthworms do the deep tilling — they'll show up once you add organic matter

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't add sand to clay. In the wrong proportions, you get something resembling adobe brick. You'd need to add sand at a 1:1 ratio to make a difference, which is impractical for most gardens.
- Don't rototill wet clay. You'll create clods that take years to break down.
- Don't skip the compost. There's no shortcut. Organic matter is the answer to almost every clay soil problem.

## Building Raised Beds: The Texas Gardener's Best Friend

Raised beds solve so many Texas gardening problems that they deserve special attention. They let you:

- Control your soil composition regardless of what's underneath
- Improve drainage (critical in clay soils and flood-prone areas)
- Warm up earlier in spring
- Reduce weed pressure
- Save your back and knees

**Materials:**
- **Cedar** — Naturally rot-resistant, lasts 8–15 years. The Texas standard. Expect to pay $40–80 per 4×8 bed depending on wood prices.
- **Galvanized steel** — Increasingly popular. Lasts decades. Gets hot in summer but drains well. $80–150 per bed.
- **Concrete blocks** — Cheap, permanent, ugly (unless you paint them). About $25 per 4×8 bed.
- **Avoid treated lumber** — Modern pressure-treated wood (ACQ) is considered safe by most extension services, but many gardeners prefer to avoid it for food production. Your call.

**Size recommendations:**
- Width: 3–4 feet maximum (you need to reach the center from both sides)
- Length: 4–8 feet is standard; longer is fine if you add cross supports
- Depth: 12 inches minimum for most vegetables; 18 inches for root crops and if you're building on top of caliche or concrete

**Filling your beds:**
Skip the "lasagna" or "Hügelkultur" methods for your first beds — just fill them with good soil. A solid mix:
- 50% quality topsoil
- 30% compost
- 20% coarse vermiculite or expanded shale (for drainage)

For a 4×8×12-inch bed, you'll need about 32 cubic feet of fill. Budget $80–150 depending on your source. Bulk delivery from a local landscape supply company is far cheaper than buying bags at the hardware store.

## Composting in Texas Heat

Texas heat accelerates composting in a way that northern gardeners would envy. A pile that takes 6 months in Minnesota can finish in 6–8 weeks here during summer.

**Hot composting basics:**
1. Build a pile at least 3×3×3 feet
2. Layer browns (dead leaves, cardboard, straw) and greens (kitchen scraps, grass clippings, green garden waste) at roughly a 3:1 ratio by volume
3. Keep it moist — like a wrung-out sponge. In Texas summer, you may need to water your compost pile.
4. Turn every 1–2 weeks

**Texas-specific tips:**
- Locate your compost in partial shade — full Texas sun will dry it out faster than you can water it
- Pecan leaves compost fine despite the myth that they're toxic (the allelopathic compound juglone breaks down during composting)
- Fireant prevention: keep your pile hot and moist. Dry, cool piles become fire ant hotels.
- Don't compost Bermuda grass runners — they'll survive anything short of a nuclear event

> **Pro Tip:** Many Texas cities offer free or cheap compost from their municipal composting programs. Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and DFW all have them. Check your city's website — you might get a truckload of quality compost for the cost of delivery.

## Mulching Strategies for Water Conservation

Mulch is the single most impactful thing you can do in a Texas garden. It:

- Reduces water evaporation by 50–70%
- Keeps soil temperatures 10–15°F cooler in summer
- Suppresses weeds
- Feeds the soil as it decomposes
- Prevents soil crusting and erosion

**Best mulches for Texas vegetable gardens:**

| Mulch Type | Depth | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Shredded hardwood | 3–4" | Excellent all-purpose. Available free from tree services. |
| Straw (not hay!) | 4–6" | Classic vegetable garden mulch. Hay contains weed seeds; straw doesn't. |
| Pecan shells | 2–3" | Beautiful, long-lasting, available in pecan country. Slightly acidic. |
| Pine needles | 3–4" | Great in East Texas. Slightly acidic — good for blueberries, not great on alkaline soil. |
| Compost | 2–3" | Does double duty as mulch and amendment. Breaks down fast. |
| Live mulch | N/A | Clover or cowpeas between rows. Fixes nitrogen. |

**Avoid:**
- Dyed mulch (the dye is cosmetic and some contain contaminants)
- Rubber mulch (doesn't decompose, gets blisteringly hot)
- Fresh wood chips directly against vegetable stems (nitrogen tie-up at soil surface)

Pull mulch back 1–2 inches from plant stems to prevent rot. Replenish as it decomposes — in Texas heat, you'll add mulch 2–3 times per year.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not testing soil before amending.** You might be adding lime to soil that's already alkaline. Test first.
- **Adding sand to clay.** Just don't. Add compost instead.
- **Beds too shallow.** Eight inches isn't enough for most vegetables, especially in Texas heat. Go 12+ inches.
- **Skipping mulch.** In Texas, unmulched soil is a death sentence for your water bill and your plants.
- **Working soil when it's too wet or too dry.** Wet clay becomes concrete; dry clay breaks your tools. Wait for that sweet spot where it crumbles when squeezed.

# Chapter 3: Water-Smart Gardening

Water is the currency of Texas gardening. Everything else — soil, seeds, sunlight — means nothing if you can't keep your plants hydrated through a summer that treats moisture the way a campfire treats marshmallows.

But here's the reality: Texas has water restrictions, periodic droughts, and aquifers that aren't getting any fuller. The days of setting a sprinkler and walking away are over (and honestly, that was always a terrible way to water a vegetable garden). Smart watering isn't just environmentally responsible — it'll save you money and grow better vegetables.

## Water Restrictions and Conservation Mindset

Most Texas cities enforce water restrictions at some level, ranging from voluntary conservation to mandatory rationing during drought. These restrictions typically target landscape irrigation, but they affect gardeners too.

Know your local rules. Most cities allow drip irrigation and hand watering even during restrictions, which is yet another reason to install drip (more on that in a moment). Many municipalities also exempt rainwater harvesting systems.

The conservation mindset goes beyond compliance. Every gallon you save through smart design is a gallon you don't have to pay for, pump from a well, or compete for during the next drought.

## Drip Irrigation Setup (Step-by-Step)

Drip irrigation is the best investment you'll make in your Texas vegetable garden. It delivers water directly to the root zone, reduces evaporation by 60–70% compared to sprinklers, keeps foliage dry (reducing disease), and can be automated with a simple timer.

**What you need:**
- Timer (battery-powered is fine) — $25–40
- Backflow preventer — $8–12
- Pressure regulator (25 PSI for most drip systems) — $8–10
- Filter (mesh or disc) — $8–12
- ½-inch mainline tubing — $0.15–0.25/foot
- ¼-inch drip tubing or emitters — $0.10–0.20/foot
- Connectors, end caps, stakes — $10–15

**Total cost for a 200 sq ft garden: $60–100**

**Installation:**

1. **Connect to your spigot:** Timer → backflow preventer → filter → pressure regulator → mainline adapter
2. **Run ½-inch mainline** along the length of your garden or raised bed
3. **Branch off with ¼-inch drip tubing** along each row. Space emitters 6–12 inches apart depending on your soil (closer for sandy, wider for clay)
4. **Cap the ends** of all lines
5. **Run the system** and check for leaks. Adjust emitter placement so each plant's root zone gets water
6. **Set your timer** (see watering schedules below)

**Maintenance:** Flush the system every month by removing end caps and running water through. Replace the filter screen when it gets clogged. In winter, drain the lines if you're in a freeze-prone area.

> **Pro Tip:** Lay your drip lines UNDER your mulch. This reduces evaporation even further and keeps the tubing from degrading in UV light. Mulch on top of drip is one of the most water-efficient combinations possible.

## Soaker Hoses vs. Sprinklers vs. Hand Watering

**Drip irrigation** is the gold standard — we just covered that.

**Soaker hoses** are the budget alternative. They work reasonably well for short runs (under 25 feet) but deliver water unevenly over longer distances. They also degrade in Texas sun within 1–2 seasons. If you use them, run them under mulch and replace them annually.

**Sprinklers** are the worst option for vegetable gardens. They waste water to evaporation (30–50% on a hot, windy Texas day), wet the foliage (hello, fungal diseases), and water the paths between rows as much as the plants. Use them for lawns if you must; keep them out of the veggie garden.

**Hand watering** with a hose is fine for small gardens and containers, but it's inconsistent. You'll overwater some areas and underwater others, and you probably won't stand out there long enough during a 105°F August afternoon.

## Rainwater Harvesting

Rainwater harvesting is legal in Texas and actively encouraged by state law. Several municipalities offer rebates on rain barrel purchases.

**Simple setup:** A 55-gallon rain barrel connected to a downspout costs $50–100 and can fill up from a single moderate rainfall on a typical roof. One inch of rain on a 1,000 sq ft roof section yields about 600 gallons.

**Advanced setup:** Multiple 275-gallon IBC totes connected in series, with a first-flush diverter and spigot for drip irrigation. Total capacity of 1,000+ gallons for $200–400.

**Texas math:** North Texas averages 36 inches of rain per year. A 2,000 sq ft roof could theoretically capture 44,000 gallons annually. You won't capture all of it, but even a fraction makes a real difference.

Rainwater is also slightly acidic (pH 5.5–6.5), which is perfect for alkaline Texas soils. Your plants will actually prefer it to municipal water.

## Ollas and Other Low-Tech Watering Solutions

**Ollas** (pronounced "oy-yahs") are unglazed terracotta pots buried in the garden and filled with water. Water seeps through the porous clay directly into the surrounding soil, pulled by the roots' suction. They've been used for thousands of years in arid climates — there's a reason.

You can buy purpose-made ollas ($20–40 each) or make your own by gluing two terracotta pots together at the rims with waterproof silicone and plugging one drainage hole. Bury them with just the top opening above soil level. Fill every 2–5 days depending on temperature and plant size.

Ollas are especially effective for:
- West Texas gardens (arid conditions)
- Container gardens
- Individual large plants (tomatoes, peppers, squash)

Other low-tech options:
- **Wicking beds** — self-watering raised beds with a water reservoir at the bottom
- **Buried bottles** — poke holes in 2-liter bottles and bury them next to plants (the poor man's olla)
- **Deep watering stakes** — direct water to the root zone of larger plants

## Watering Schedules by Season and Region

How much and how often you water depends on your soil, your plants' growth stage, and the weather. Here are starting guidelines — adjust based on what you observe.

**Spring (March–May):**
- New transplants: Daily for the first week, then every 2–3 days
- Established plants: Every 3–4 days (clay soil) to every 1–2 days (sandy soil)
- Run drip for 20–30 minutes per session

**Summer (June–August):**
- Every 1–2 days for all plants
- Water early morning (before 8 AM) to minimize evaporation
- Run drip for 30–45 minutes per session
- Container plants may need daily or twice-daily watering

**Fall (September–November):**
- Similar to spring; reduce frequency as temps drop
- Take advantage of fall rains — skip irrigation after significant rainfall
- Every 2–4 days for established plants

**Winter (December–February):**
- Active crops (greens under row covers): every 5–7 days, less if it rains
- Dormant beds: no irrigation needed

**The finger test:** Stick your finger 2 inches into the soil. If it's dry, water. If it's moist, wait. This beats any schedule you'll find in a book — including this one.

> **Pro Tip:** Water deeply and less frequently rather than shallowly and often. Deep watering encourages roots to grow down where soil stays cooler and moister. Shallow watering keeps roots near the surface where they're vulnerable to Texas heat.

## Common Mistakes

- **Watering on a fixed schedule regardless of conditions.** Use your finger, not your calendar.
- **Watering in the evening.** Wet foliage overnight breeds fungal diseases. Morning is best.
- **Using sprinklers for vegetables.** Waste of water, source of disease. Switch to drip.
- **Not mulching.** Irrigation without mulch is like filling a bathtub with the drain open.
- **Ignoring rainwater harvesting.** Free water, better pH for your soil, legal and encouraged in Texas. Set up at least one rain barrel.

# Chapter 4: Planning Your Texas Garden

Planning prevents the most common Texas gardening failure: planting too much, too late, in the wrong spot. Fifteen minutes with a pencil and paper (or a garden planning app) will save you hours of frustration and wasted seed.

## Choosing Your Garden Style

**In-ground gardens** work best if you have decent native soil (East Texas, parts of the Gulf Coast) or if you're willing to heavily amend what you have. Cost: lowest upfront but highest labor to improve poor soil. Good for large-scale growing.

**Raised beds** are the Texas standard for good reason. Control over soil, better drainage, easier maintenance. Cost: moderate ($50–150 per 4×8 bed). Best for clay, caliche, and rocky soils.

**Container gardens** are perfect for apartments, patios, and renters. Cost varies wildly. The key constraint is container size — go bigger than you think you need (minimum 5 gallons for most vegetables, 15+ for tomatoes).

**Hybrid approach** — most Texas gardeners end up here. Raised beds for the main garden, containers on the patio for herbs and salad greens, and maybe a few in-ground plantings where the soil cooperates.

## Sun Mapping Your Yard

Most vegetables need 8+ hours of direct sunlight. In Texas, this is rarely a problem — we have sun to spare. The question is whether your specific yard delivers it.

Spend a day observing:
- Where does sun hit from 8 AM to 6 PM?
- What casts shade? (Houses, fences, trees)
- Does the sun path change seasonally? (Yes — dramatically between June and December)

**Full sun (8+ hours):** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, corn, melons, okra  
**Partial sun (6–8 hours):** Lettuce, spinach, kale, herbs, root vegetables  
**Light shade (4–6 hours):** Salad greens, radishes, cilantro, mint

In Texas, some afternoon shade can actually be a benefit during summer. A spot that gets morning sun and afternoon shade is gold for heat-sensitive crops like lettuce and spinach in the shoulder seasons.

## Garden Sizing

**Beginners:** Start with one or two 4×8 raised beds. That's 64 square feet — enough to grow tomatoes, peppers, herbs, salad greens, and a few other favorites. You'll learn your rhythm without getting overwhelmed.

**Intermediate growers:** 100–200 square feet. Four to six raised beds or a 10×20 in-ground plot. Room for succession planting, crop rotation, and a wider variety.

**Experienced / Committed:** 200–500+ square feet. You know what you're doing. You probably already have opinions about determinate vs. indeterminate tomatoes and strong feelings about mulch depth.

**The universal truth:** You will plant too much your first year. Everyone does. Scale up in year two once you know what your family actually eats.

## Crop Rotation Basics

Crop rotation means not planting the same family of vegetables in the same spot year after year. This prevents disease buildup, balances soil nutrients, and breaks pest cycles.

**The simple 3-year rotation:**

| Year | Bed 1 | Bed 2 | Bed 3 |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Fruiting (tomatoes, peppers, squash) | Legumes (beans, peas) | Roots & Greens (carrots, lettuce, brassicas) |
| 2 | Legumes | Roots & Greens | Fruiting |
| 3 | Roots & Greens | Fruiting | Legumes |

This works for most home gardens. The key principle: don't put tomatoes where tomatoes (or peppers, or eggplant — they're all nightshades) were last year.

## Succession Planting for Continuous Harvests

Instead of planting all your beans at once and getting 40 pounds in one week, plant a new row every 2–3 weeks. You'll get a steady supply rather than a feast-or-famine cycle.

Best candidates for succession planting in Texas:
- Beans (every 2–3 weeks, spring and fall)
- Lettuce (every 2 weeks, fall through spring)
- Radishes (every 2 weeks — they mature in 30 days)
- Cucumbers (2 plantings, 3 weeks apart)
- Squash (2 plantings, 3 weeks apart)
- Corn (every 2 weeks for 3 plantings — or you'll have too much at once and none later)

## Companion Planting Quick Reference

Companion planting isn't magic, but there's solid evidence for some combinations:

| Plant | Good Companions | Bad Companions |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Tomatoes | Basil, carrots, marigolds | Fennel, brassicas |
| Peppers | Basil, onions, spinach | Fennel, kohlrabi |
| Beans | Corn, squash, cucumbers | Onions, garlic |
| Squash | Beans, corn, radishes | Potatoes |
| Corn | Beans, squash (Three Sisters) | Tomatoes |
| Lettuce | Carrots, radishes, strawberries | None significant |
| Brassicas | Onions, dill, chamomile | Tomatoes, strawberries |

**Marigolds** deserve special mention. French marigolds planted throughout the vegetable garden repel whiteflies, deter nematodes, and attract beneficial insects. They're the bodyguards of the vegetable garden.

## Tool Essentials — What You Actually Need

Skip the 47-piece gardening tool set. Here's what Texas vegetable gardeners actually use:

**Must-have:**
- Digging fork or broadfork (better than a spade for clay soil)
- Hand trowel
- Hori-hori knife (the most versatile garden tool ever made)
- Bypass pruners
- Garden hose with adjustable nozzle
- Wheelbarrow or garden cart
- Sun hat and good gloves

**Very useful:**
- Stirrup hoe (the best weeding tool for Texas gardens)
- Soil thermometer (for timing plantings)
- Row cover fabric and hoops
- Drip irrigation system (see Chapter 3)

**Nice to have:**
- Broadfork (for deep aeration without tilling)
- Soil blocker (for starting seeds)
- Garden journal (or use your phone)

**Skip:**
- Rototiller (compacts clay subsurface, destroys soil structure)
- Sprinkler system (for lawns, not veggie gardens)
- Decorative anything (this is a food garden, not a Pinterest board)

> **Pro Tip:** A soil thermometer costs $10 and tells you more about planting readiness than any calendar. Tomatoes want 65°F soil. Beans want 60°F. Lettuce seeds germinate best at 45–65°F. Stick the thermometer 4 inches deep, check it in the morning, and plant when the soil says it's time.

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting too big.** Two raised beds, well-tended, will outproduce six neglected ones every time.
- **Ignoring sun exposure.** That shady corner won't grow tomatoes, no matter how badly you want it to.
- **Skipping crop rotation.** It catches up with you by year 2 or 3. Same-spot planting means disease buildup.
- **Not planning for succession.** One big planting = one big harvest followed by nothing. Stagger it.
- **Buying tools you don't need.** A hori-hori, pruners, and a hoe will handle 90% of garden tasks.

# Part II: Month-by-Month Growing Guide

This is the heart of the book. Twelve months of specific, actionable guidance for what to do in your Texas vegetable garden right now. Each month includes tasks organized by priority, with regional notes where planting dates or tasks differ across the state.

Remember: Texas is huge. Your specific region's timing will vary. When in doubt, use soil temperature and your local frost dates rather than the calendar.

---

# Chapter 5: January — Planning and Prep

January in Texas ranges from genuinely cold (North Texas, West Texas) to "Is it even winter?" (South Texas, Gulf Coast). But regardless of where you are, January is a planning month. What you do now — the seeds you order, the beds you prepare, the transplants you start — sets the stage for your entire spring garden.

## Order Seeds

Do this first. Popular varieties sell out early, especially from Texas-specific seed companies. Don't wait until February when everyone else remembers they wanted to garden this year.

**Recommended Texas seed companies:**
- **Southern Exposure Seed Exchange** — excellent heat-tolerant varieties
- **Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds** — huge selection, many warm-climate varieties
- **Native Seeds/SEARCH** — desert-adapted varieties perfect for West and South Texas
- **Botanical Interests** — reliable, widely available, excellent packet information
- **Texas Ready Seeds** — specifically curated for Texas growing conditions

What to order for spring:
- Tomato and pepper seeds (starting indoors this month)
- Bean, squash, and cucumber seeds (direct sowing in March–April)
- Herb seeds (basil, dill, cilantro, parsley)
- Cool-season crop seeds if you haven't already planted them (lettuce, spinach, brassicas)

## Start Indoor Seeds

**Now is the time** to start tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant indoors. These need 6–8 weeks of indoor growing before they're ready to transplant outside, which means:

- **North Texas:** Start January 15–30 for a mid-March to early April transplant
- **Central Texas:** Start January 10–25 for a mid-March transplant
- **Gulf Coast:** Start January 1–15 for a late February transplant
- **South Texas:** Start December–January (or buy transplants in February)
- **West Texas:** Start January 20–February 5 for an April transplant

**Indoor seed starting basics:**
1. Use a quality seed-starting mix (not garden soil — too heavy, too buggy)
2. Plant seeds ¼ inch deep in cells or small pots
3. Keep soil temperature at 75–85°F for germination (a heat mat helps enormously — $20–30)
4. Provide 14–16 hours of light once seeds sprout (a south-facing window works for some, but a simple shop light hung 2–3 inches above seedlings is more reliable)
5. Thin to one seedling per cell once true leaves appear
6. Harden off for 7–10 days before transplanting outside

## Garden Bed Prep and Soil Amendment

If you didn't prep your beds in fall, January is catch-up time.

- **Test your soil** if you haven't in the past 2 years (see Chapter 2)
- **Add compost** — 3–4 inches worked into the top 6–8 inches
- **Apply amendments** based on your soil test results (sulfur for alkaline soil, lime for acidic, specific nutrients as needed)
- **Check your drip irrigation** — flush lines, replace cracked emitters, test the timer

## Cover Crops and Green Manures

If you planted cover crops last fall (crimson clover, winter rye, Austrian winter peas), they should be growing vigorously. Leave them in place until 2–3 weeks before you want to plant. Then:

1. Cut or mow the cover crop
2. Work the residue into the top few inches of soil (or just lay it down as mulch)
3. Wait 2–3 weeks for decomposition before planting — fresh green material can tie up nitrogen temporarily

## Cold Frames and Row Covers

If you're growing cool-season crops through winter (you should be!), January is when cold frames and row covers earn their keep.

**Row covers (floating row cover / frost cloth):**
- Lightweight (0.5 oz/sq yard) — adds 2–4°F of protection, lets in 85% of light
- Medium weight (1.0 oz) — adds 6–8°F, lets in 70% of light
- Heavyweight (1.5 oz) — adds 8–10°F, lets in 50% of light

Support them on wire hoops or PVC to keep the fabric off plant leaves. Fabric resting directly on foliage can still transmit frost.

**Cold frames:**
A simple cold frame — basically a bottomless box with a transparent lid — can keep greens growing through the coldest Texas winter. Even a repurposed window sash over a raised bed works. Open the lid on warm, sunny days (above 50°F) to prevent overheating.

## Regional Notes

**South Texas / Rio Grande Valley:** Your cool-season garden is in full swing. Harvest lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. Direct sow more cool-season crops for late-winter harvest. You can start warm-season transplants now — tomatoes and peppers can go outside by mid-February.

**Gulf Coast:** Similar to South Texas but slightly behind. Cool-season crops are producing. Start tomatoes and peppers indoors early January for late February transplant.

**Central Texas:** Cool-season crops under row covers are still going. Start warm-season seeds indoors mid-January. Prep beds for March planting.

**North Texas:** The coldest month. Garden is dormant except for cold-frame greens. Focus on planning, seed ordering, and indoor seed starting. Prep beds on warmer days if soil isn't frozen or waterlogged.

**West Texas:** Similar to North Texas timing but drier. If you have a cold frame, you can harvest greens. Order seeds, start indoor transplants late January.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting too long to start seeds indoors.** January feels early, but 6–8 weeks goes fast. Late-started transplants mean late planting, which means less harvest before summer heat.
- **Not ordering seeds early.** The best varieties sell out by February.
- **Skipping bed prep.** Amending soil is much easier when the beds are empty. Do it now.
- **Ignoring cold-frame potential.** Even a simple setup extends your growing season by months.

# Chapter 6: February — Early Spring Action

February is when Texas gardening shifts from planning to doing. Down in the Valley, you're already eating salads from the garden. Up in Dallas, you're eyeing the forecast and watching for that last hard freeze. Everyone's itching to plant something.

This month separates the good Texas gardeners from the impatient ones. Plant your cool-season crops at the right time and they'll reward you with weeks of harvest. Jump the gun on warm-season crops and you'll lose them to a late freeze.

## Cool-Season Transplants Go In

If you didn't get your cool-season transplants in the ground in fall (or if you want a spring round), February is your window for most of Texas:

**Transplant outdoors:**
- Broccoli
- Cabbage
- Cauliflower
- Kale
- Lettuce (transplants or direct sow)
- Swiss chard
- Kohlrabi

**Timing by region:**
- **South Texas / Gulf Coast:** Early February — you may already have these in the ground
- **Central Texas:** February 1–15
- **North Texas:** February 15–28 (with frost protection ready)
- **West Texas:** Late February to early March (with protection)

These crops can handle light frost (down to 28°F for most), so don't stress about a late cold snap — just have row covers on standby.

## Direct Sow Cool-Season Crops

February is prime direct-sowing time for:

- **Peas** (English, snap, and snow) — Sow as soon as soil is workable. They like cool weather and will die when it gets hot, so earlier is better.
- **Radishes** — 30 days to harvest. Sow every 2 weeks for continuous supply.
- **Carrots** — Sow now for spring harvest. They take 70–80 days, so don't delay.
- **Beets** — Direct sow; they don't transplant well.
- **Spinach** — Direct sow or transplant. Bolts fast once warm weather arrives.
- **Lettuce** — Direct sow or transplant. Succession-plant every 2 weeks.
- **Turnips** — Direct sow for both roots and greens.

## Potato Planting: The Valentine's Day Tradition

In Texas, the traditional potato planting date is Valentine's Day (February 14). It's not a hard rule, but it's a solid guideline for Central and North Texas. Gulf Coast and South Texas can go a few weeks earlier.

**How to plant potatoes in Texas:**

1. Buy **certified seed potatoes** (not grocery store potatoes — those are often treated to prevent sprouting)
2. Cut large seed potatoes into pieces, each with 2–3 eyes. Let cut surfaces dry for 1–2 days.
3. Plant 4 inches deep, 12 inches apart, in rows 36 inches apart (or in a raised bed, 12 inches apart in all directions)
4. As plants grow, hill soil or mulch around the stems, leaving 4–6 inches of foliage exposed. This encourages more tuber formation.
5. Harvest when tops die back (usually May–June)

**Best varieties for Texas:** Kennebec, Red LaSoda, Yukon Gold, Red Pontiac

> **Pro Tip:** "New potatoes" — small, thin-skinned, incredibly delicious — can be harvested about 60 days after planting by carefully reaching into the hill and stealing a few tubers. The plant will keep growing and producing full-size potatoes.

## Prepare Tomato and Pepper Transplants

Your indoor-started tomatoes and peppers should be growing strong by now. Keep them under lights, feed with half-strength liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks, and start hardening off 7–10 days before your planned transplant date.

**Hardening off:**
1. Day 1–2: Set plants outside in a sheltered, shady spot for 2 hours
2. Day 3–4: Increase to 4 hours, some direct morning sun
3. Day 5–7: 6+ hours, more direct sun
4. Day 8–10: Full day outside, bring in only if frost threatens
5. Transplant into the garden

If you didn't start seeds, nurseries and garden centers start stocking transplants this month. Buying transplants is absolutely fine — no shame in it. Look for stocky, dark green plants with no flowers yet (you want the plant putting energy into roots, not fruit, at transplant time).

## Frost Protection Strategies

February in Texas is the month of the sucker punch — a 78°F day followed by a 24°F night. Have frost protection ready at all times.

**For established plants and transplants:**
- Row cover fabric over wire hoops (best reusable option)
- Old bedsheets or blankets (works in a pinch — remove in the morning)
- Christmas lights under row covers (the old-fashioned incandescent kind generate heat; LEDs don't)
- Wall-o-Waters or similar water-filled protectors around individual plants (add 10–15°F of protection)

**What NOT to use:**
- Plastic sheeting directly on plants (conducts cold and can damage foliage)
- Nothing. Don't gamble. A $15 roll of row cover is cheaper than replanting your entire spring garden.

## Regional Notes

**South Texas / Rio Grande Valley:** You're 2–4 weeks ahead of the rest of the state. Transplant tomatoes and peppers outside by mid-February. Direct sow beans, squash, and cucumbers by late February. Your spring garden is already in full production mode while North Texas is still defrosting.

**Gulf Coast:** Transplant tomatoes around February 15–28. Direct sow warm-season crops by late February. Watch for late cold fronts from the north — they're rare but devastating.

**Central Texas:** Transplant cool-season crops early February. Warm-season transplants go out in early to mid-March — not yet. Use this month to finish bed prep.

**North Texas:** The trickiest month. Cool-season transplants can go out mid-month with protection. Warm-season crops stay inside until mid-March at the earliest. Don't let a warm week in February trick you into planting tomatoes — it's a trap.

**West Texas:** Similar to North Texas timing. Wind protection is as important as frost protection. Use row covers and windbreaks.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting tomatoes too early.** Unless you're in South Texas or the Gulf Coast, wait until March (or later). A single freeze kills a tomato transplant dead. Patience now = tomatoes later.
- **Forgetting peas.** They need to go in NOW. Once it's hot, pea season is over. They're one of the easiest, most rewarding spring crops.
- **Not succession planting radishes and lettuce.** Plant a little every 2 weeks and you'll have salads for months instead of a mountain of radishes on one day.
- **Using grocery store potatoes for seed.** Get certified seed potatoes. They're disease-free and bred to produce tubers, not just sit in a bag.

# Chapter 7: March — Spring Planting Surge

March is it. This is the month Texas gardeners have been waiting for since last summer's heat drove them indoors. If there's a single most important month for your spring garden, it's March.

The last frost dates are passing (or have passed) for most of the state. Soil temperatures are climbing. The garden centers are packed. Everyone is planting everything.

Channel that energy, but be strategic. What you plant in March — and how you plant it — determines whether you'll be harvesting tomatoes in June or staring at crispy, heat-stressed plants that never got established.

## Transplant Tomatoes and Peppers

This is the headline event. Once your soil temperature is consistently above 65°F and your last frost date has passed (or is imminent), it's tomato and pepper time.

**Transplanting tomatoes:**
1. Dig a hole deep enough to bury 2/3 of the stem (tomatoes root along buried stems — this creates a stronger root system)
2. Add a handful of compost and a tablespoon of bone meal to the hole
3. Remove lower leaves from the buried section
4. Water deeply at planting
5. Install your cage or stake NOW — not after the plant is 4 feet tall and flopping over
6. Mulch 3–4 inches, keeping mulch 2 inches away from the stem

**Transplanting peppers:**
Same process but plant at the same depth they were in the pot (peppers don't root from stems like tomatoes).

**Timing by region:**
- **South Texas:** Already done — you planted in February
- **Gulf Coast:** Early March
- **Central Texas:** March 1–15
- **North Texas:** March 15–31 (watch the forecast)
- **West Texas:** Late March to early April

## Direct Sow Warm-Season Crops

Once soil temperatures reach 60–70°F, direct sow:

- **Beans** (snap, pole, lima) — soil temp 60°F+. Plant 1 inch deep, 4–6 inches apart. Pole beans need a trellis.
- **Squash** (summer and winter) — soil temp 65°F+. Plant in hills, 3–4 seeds per hill, thin to 2. Space hills 4–6 feet apart.
- **Cucumbers** — soil temp 65°F+. Plant 1 inch deep, trellis recommended (saves space, cleaner fruit).
- **Corn** — soil temp 65°F+. Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows for pollination (corn is wind-pollinated — a single row won't cut it). Seeds 1 inch deep, 12 inches apart, rows 30 inches apart.
- **Melons** (watermelon, cantaloupe) — soil temp 70°F+. These are space hogs. Give each plant 6–8 feet of running room, or train them vertically on a strong trellis.

## Herb Planting

March is prime herb-planting time:

- **Basil** — Wait until nighttime temps are consistently above 50°F. Direct sow or transplant. Plant lots — you'll use it.
- **Cilantro** — Direct sow now; it bolts quickly in heat, so enjoy it while you can. Succession-plant every 3 weeks until it's too hot (usually May). Plant again in September.
- **Dill** — Direct sow. Bolts in heat like cilantro. Attracts beneficial insects.
- **Parsley** — Transplant or direct sow. Slow to germinate (2–3 weeks). Handles heat better than cilantro.

Perennial herbs like rosemary, sage, thyme, and oregano can be transplanted now too. These are tough-as-nails in Texas once established.

## Pest Watch

Spring brings pests along with growth. Start monitoring now:

- **Aphids** — Clusters of tiny green, black, or white insects on new growth. Blast with water or spray insecticidal soap. Ladybugs eat them by the hundreds.
- **Cutworms** — Larvae that chew through seedling stems at ground level, usually at night. Protect transplants with cardboard collars (toilet paper tubes work) pushed 1 inch into the soil.
- **Flea beetles** — Tiny jumping beetles that pepper leaves with small holes. Row cover is the best prevention. Neem oil or spinosad for treatment.

## Trellis and Support Installation

Install all trellises, cages, stakes, and support structures NOW, at planting time. Not later. Not when the plants are already tall and tangled. Now.

**Tomato support options:**
- **Texas tomato cages** (the heavy-gauge concrete reinforcing wire cylinders) — far superior to those flimsy cone-shaped things from the hardware store. Make your own: buy a 5-foot-tall roll of concrete reinforcing wire mesh (6-inch openings), cut a 6-foot length, and bend it into a cylinder. Secure with zip ties. This will support even the most vigorous indeterminate tomato.
- **Stakes and string** (the Florida weave) — drive sturdy stakes every 2–3 plants, weave twine between plants as they grow. Good for determinate varieties.

**Trellis for beans, cucumbers, and small melons:**
- Cattle panels bent into arches make excellent tunnel trellises
- Simple A-frame trellises with string or netting
- T-post and wire setups for long rows

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** You're already harvesting spring crops. Continue succession plantings. Start thinking about heat management.

**Gulf Coast:** Peak planting. Everything goes in this month. Watch for late cold fronts through mid-March.

**Central Texas:** The big month. Tomatoes and peppers go out March 1–15. Direct sow everything else mid to late March.

**North Texas:** Wait for soil to warm. Tomatoes go out after March 15 (check your local forecast). Direct sow warm-season crops late March if soil is 65°F+. Better to be a week late than a week early — a late frost wipes out everything.

**West Texas:** Still frost-risky through late March. Use season extension techniques. Plant after April 1 if you're cautious. Wind protection is critical for young transplants.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting too deep (peppers) or too shallow (tomatoes).** Bury tomato stems deep; plant peppers at pot level.
- **Forgetting to install supports at planting time.** You'll damage roots if you drive stakes next to a mature plant.
- **Spacing too closely.** Give plants room. Crowded plants get less light, less airflow, and more disease. Follow the spacing on the seed packet.
- **Planting corn in a single row.** Corn needs blocks for wind pollination. One row = no ears.

# Chapter 8: April — Peak Spring Garden

April is the month when your garden goes from "rows of hopeful transplants" to "actual food growing out of the ground." Everything is growing fast, the weather is gorgeous (usually), and you're starting to believe this whole gardening thing might work.

It's also the month where maintenance becomes a real job. Weeds are growing as fast as your vegetables. Pests are multiplying. And the heat is starting to build — you can feel summer crouching just off-stage.

## Succession Plantings

Keep the production line going:
- **Beans** — Plant another round every 2–3 weeks through April
- **Squash** — A second planting now provides harvests into June
- **Cucumbers** — Second planting extends the season
- **Lettuce** — Switch to heat-tolerant varieties (like Jericho, Black Seeded Simpson, or Muir). These will bolt eventually, but they'll give you a few more weeks of salads.

## Sweet Potato Slips

April is sweet potato planting month for most of Texas. Sweet potatoes need warm soil (65°F+) and a long growing season (90–120 days).

**How to plant sweet potato slips:**
1. Buy slips from a nursery or garden center (or grow your own by suspending a sweet potato in water until it sprouts — but this takes 6+ weeks, so you'd need to start in February)
2. Plant slips 4–6 inches deep, 12–18 inches apart
3. Water well at planting, then reduce — sweet potatoes are drought-tolerant once established
4. Mulch heavily
5. Don't fertilize with high nitrogen — you'll get gorgeous vines and no tubers

**Best varieties for Texas:** Beauregard (the standard), Jewel, Covington, and for something fun, Purple Murasaki

## Okra and Southern Peas

Two crops that love Texas heat go in this month:

**Okra** — Direct sow when soil is 70°F+. Soak seeds overnight for faster germination. Plant 1 inch deep, 12–18 inches apart. Okra will grow 4–8 feet tall by midsummer and produce until frost. Harvest pods at 3–4 inches for tenderness.

**Southern peas** (black-eyed peas, cream peas, crowder peas, purple hull peas) — Direct sow, 1 inch deep, 4 inches apart. These thrive in heat, fix nitrogen in the soil, and are a Texas garden staple. Harvest for fresh shelling or let pods dry on the vine for dried peas.

## First Harvests

Your patience is paying off:
- **Lettuce** — Cut-and-come-again harvesting: take outer leaves, leave the center to keep growing
- **Radishes** — Pull when the root tops are 1 inch in diameter
- **Peas** — Pick when pods are plump (snap peas) or when you can see the peas through the pod (English peas)
- **Spinach** — Harvest outer leaves or cut the whole plant before it bolts
- **Broccoli** — Cut the main head when it's tight (before yellow flowers appear). Side shoots will produce smaller heads for weeks.
- **Kale** — Pick lower leaves; the plant keeps producing from the top

## Pest Management Ramps Up

April brings increasing pest pressure:

- **Squash vine borers** — The most devastating spring pest. Adults lay eggs at the base of squash plants in April–May. Cover stems with row cover or wrap the lower 6 inches with aluminum foil. Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) injected into stems can save an infested plant.
- **Tomato hornworms** — Large green caterpillars that can defoliate a tomato plant overnight. Hand-pick them (they're big enough to spot). If you see one covered in white cocoons, leave it — those are parasitic wasp eggs, and that hornworm is already doomed.
- **Aphids** — Still going. Encourage ladybugs and lacewings. A strong blast of water from the hose knocks them off.

## Mulch Everything

If you haven't mulched yet, this is your final warning. Summer is coming, and unmulched soil in Texas will hit 140°F at the surface. Roots cook. Water evaporates in hours. Weeds explode.

Apply 3–4 inches of straw, shredded hardwood, or other organic mulch over every bed. Around every plant. In every path. Mulch is not optional in Texas.

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** Summer heat is arriving. Cool-season crops are bolting. Shift to heat-tolerant varieties. Ensure shade cloth is ready.

**Gulf Coast:** Peak production. Watch humidity-related diseases (powdery mildew, early blight). Fungal management starts now.

**Central Texas:** Everything is growing fast. Stay on top of watering as temperatures climb.

**North Texas:** This is your best month. Enjoy it. Plant succession crops, harvest cool-season produce, and give your warm-season transplants all the attention they need.

**West Texas:** Spring planting continues — you're behind the rest of the state by a few weeks. Protect from wind and late cold snaps.

## Common Mistakes

- **Letting squash vine borers get established.** Prevention is 10x easier than cure. Cover stems now.
- **Harvesting broccoli too late.** Once those tight green buds open into yellow flowers, you've missed the window.
- **Skipping succession planting.** You'll regret having zero beans in May when you planted them all in March.
- **Not mulching by April.** By May it's almost too late — the heat advantage is lost.

---

# Chapter 9: May — Harvesting and Heat Prep

May is the Texas gardener's victory lap — and the start of the great retreat. Your spring garden is producing at peak capacity. Tomatoes are ripening. Peppers are sizing up. Squash is threatening to take over the yard. The lettuce has finally bolted, and you're drowning in beans.

Enjoy it. This abundance won't last long.

By late May, temperatures are pushing into the 90s and 100s, and your spring garden is running on borrowed time. Smart gardeners use May to harvest like crazy, pull spent crops, and prepare for the summer transition.

## Major Harvest Month

May is peak harvest for:

- **Tomatoes** — Pick when fully colored (or slightly before — they'll ripen on the counter and avoid bird/squirrel theft). Once nighttime temps stay above 75°F, tomato fruit set drops dramatically.
- **Peppers** — Still producing well. Most peppers handle heat better than tomatoes.
- **Squash** — Harvest summer squash at 6–8 inches. Check DAILY — a zucchini can go from perfect to baseball bat in 48 hours.
- **Beans** — Pick snap beans when pencil-thick. Regular picking encourages more production.
- **Cucumbers** — Harvest at 6–8 inches for slicers, 2–4 inches for picklers.
- **Onions** — Spring-planted onions are sizing up. When tops fall over, stop watering. Harvest a week later.

> **Pro Tip:** Preserve the abundance. Tomatoes can be roasted and frozen, made into sauce, or canned. Peppers freeze beautifully — just wash, dry, and throw them in freezer bags whole. Herbs can be dried, frozen in olive oil in ice cube trays, or made into pesto. A morning of processing means garden-fresh flavor all winter.

## Remove Bolting Cool-Season Crops

By May, your cool-season crops are done:
- Lettuce, spinach, and cilantro have bolted (sent up flower stalks)
- Peas are finished
- Broccoli and cauliflower may still have side shoots producing, but the main harvest is over

Pull them. Compost the plants (unless diseased). Free up that space for summer plantings or rest the bed.

But don't waste those bolting herbs — let cilantro and dill go to seed. Cilantro seeds are coriander (a spice). Dill seeds flavor pickles. And both self-sow, giving you volunteer plants next fall.

## Plant Heat-Lovers

While spring crops wind down, double down on the crops that love Texas summer:

- **Okra** — If you didn't plant in April, early May is your last chance for a full season.
- **Sweet potatoes** — Still planting through May. They'll grow all summer.
- **Southern peas** — Black-eyed peas, cream peas, and purple hulls thrive in heat.
- **Yard-long beans** — An Asian variety that laughs at 100°F days when conventional beans have quit.
- **Malabar spinach** — Not a true spinach, but a heat-loving vine with similar-tasting leaves. Perfect summer green.

## Shade Cloth Installation

By late May, shade cloth becomes necessary for heat-sensitive crops:

- **30% shade cloth** — For tomatoes and peppers to extend production into June
- **50% shade cloth** — For lettuce and greens (if you're trying to push them through early summer)
- **70% shade cloth** — For you, sitting in the garden. (Not really — that's too much shade for vegetables. But your comfort matters too.)

Install shade cloth on the west and south sides of the garden, or drape it over a frame above heat-sensitive crops. It reduces temperature, UV stress, and water needs.

## Fire Ant Management

If you garden in Texas, you garden with fire ants. These aggressive, venomous insects build mounds in garden beds and bite without mercy.

**Control options:**
- **Bait (Amdro, Extinguish Plus)** — Broadcast bait around (not on) mounds. Workers carry it to the queen. Most effective long-term strategy. Apply in spring and fall.
- **Mound drench (spinosad-based)** — Pour directly on the mound. Kills that colony but doesn't prevent new ones.
- **Boiling water** — 3 gallons of boiling water poured on the mound. Kills about 60% of mounds on first treatment. Free, organic, satisfying.
- **Diatomaceous earth** — Dust around the base of plants. Discourages but doesn't eliminate.
- **Orange oil drench** — Mix 2 oz orange oil + 1 tablespoon liquid dish soap per gallon of water. Effective and organic.

> **Pro Tip:** The two-step method recommended by Texas A&M AgriLife: (1) Broadcast fire ant bait over the entire garden area in spring and fall. (2) Treat individual problem mounds directly. This combination provides 80–90% control.

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** Summer is in full force. Spring garden is winding down. Transition to heat-tolerant crops and prepare for the long summer dormancy.

**Gulf Coast:** Humidity is climbing. Disease pressure increases. Harvest tomatoes early if needed to avoid cracking and blossom end rot.

**Central Texas:** Peak production transitioning to heat management. Start planning fall garden NOW — July seed starting is only 6 weeks away.

**North Texas:** Your best harvest month. Enjoy every tomato. By late May, 95°F+ days start appearing.

**West Texas:** Spring garden may still be going strong thanks to cooler nights. Low humidity helps extend the tomato season.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not harvesting daily.** Overripe squash, burst tomatoes, and woody beans are wasted production. Pick early and often.
- **Leaving bolted cool-season crops in the ground.** They're done. Pull them and free up space.
- **Ignoring shade cloth.** An extra 2–3 weeks of tomato production is worth the $20 investment.
- **Fighting fire ants one mound at a time.** Use the broadcast bait + individual mound treatment two-step method.

# Chapter 10: June — Summer Strategy

June is the transition month. The triumphant spring garden is yielding to the relentless Texas summer. Tomatoes are slowing down or stopping. The last of the squash is coming in. Okra and peppers are the holdouts, still producing in the face of triple-digit heat.

Your job in June is threefold: harvest what's left, maintain what's surviving, and — this is the part people miss — start planning for fall.

## Harvest Tomatoes Before Extreme Heat

When daytime temperatures consistently exceed 95°F and nighttime temps stay above 75°F, tomato plants stop setting fruit. The blossoms drop without pollinating. Existing green tomatoes will ripen, but no new ones are forming.

**Decision time:**
- **Green tomatoes** can be harvested and ripened indoors on the counter (not in a window — indirect light is fine). They'll ripen in 1–2 weeks.
- **Pull declining plants** and compost them (if disease-free) to free up bed space.
- **Or keep them alive** under shade cloth with consistent water, and they may resume production when temps cool in September. This only works with healthy, well-established plants.

## Maintain Summer Crops

What's still going in June:
- **Okra** — Thriving. Harvest every 1–2 days. Pods get tough fast.
- **Sweet potatoes** — Growing vigorously. Just water and stay out of their way.
- **Southern peas** — Producing through the heat.
- **Peppers** — Some varieties keep producing (especially hot peppers). Others slow down. Shade cloth helps.
- **Yard-long beans** — Peak production starts now.
- **Malabar spinach** — Growing fast in the heat.

## Summer Cover Crops in Empty Beds

Don't leave empty beds bare — they'll become weed factories. Plant summer cover crops:

- **Cowpeas (iron clay or similar)** — Fix nitrogen, tolerate heat, suppress weeds. Chop and incorporate before fall planting.
- **Buckwheat** — Quick-growing, attracts pollinators, smothers weeds. Matures in 30 days.
- **Sorghum-sudan grass** — Deep roots break up clay, adds massive organic matter when chopped. Gets tall — mow at 3 feet and let it regrow.

## Water Management Intensifies

June water demands are serious:
- Check drip irrigation daily — emitters clog, lines crack in heat
- Water early morning (before 7 AM if possible)
- Container plants may need twice-daily watering
- Mulch should be 4+ inches everywhere

A 4×8 raised bed can lose 10–15 gallons of water per day to evaporation and plant uptake in June heat. If your drip system runs 30 minutes and delivers 1 gallon per emitter per hour, do the math and make sure you're keeping up.

## Planning the Fall Garden

Yes, already. The fall garden is actually more productive than spring for many Texas gardeners, and planning starts now.

**Fall planning checklist for June:**
1. Review what worked and didn't in spring (journal it!)
2. Decide what to grow in fall (repeat winners, skip failures, try new things)
3. Order fall seeds NOW — varieties sell out in summer too
4. Calculate transplant start dates (see Chapter 11)
5. Plan bed rotations (don't plant nightshades where you just had nightshades)

**Seeds to order for fall:**
- Tomato and pepper varieties (for July indoor start)
- Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts (for July indoor start)
- Bean, squash, and cucumber seeds (for August direct sow)
- Cool-season crops: lettuce, spinach, kale, carrots, beets, radishes (for September–October sowing)

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** Peak summer. Garden is mostly dormant except for the toughest crops. Water minimally and wait for October.

**Gulf Coast:** Brutal humidity and heat. Hurricane season has started. Monitor forecasts.

**Central Texas:** Triple digits arriving. Focus on survival crops and fall planning.

**North Texas:** Summer in full swing. 100°F+ days. Maintain okra and peppers; start fall planning.

**West Texas:** Extreme heat but low humidity. Desert crops and drip-irrigated peppers can do well. Water is the limiting factor.

## Common Mistakes

- **Giving up.** June feels like the end of gardening, but it's really just halftime. The fall season is ahead.
- **Not ordering fall seeds.** Popular varieties sell out. Order in June, plant in July–August.
- **Wasting water on dying spring crops.** If the tomatoes are done, pull them. Don't water ghosts.
- **Leaving beds empty.** Bare soil = weeds, erosion, and lost organic matter. Cover crop or mulch.

# Chapter 11: July — The Dead Zone (Surviving Summer)

July is the month when non-gardeners look at you funny. "You're gardening? In THIS heat?" Yes. Sort of. July is less about growing and more about enduring — keeping the survivors alive, starting the fall garden indoors, and preparing beds for August planting.

If January is the planning month, July is its hot, sweaty twin. The garden is quiet. The real action is inside.

## What Still Grows

The July holdouts:
- **Okra** — Peak month. Harvest daily. It doesn't care about 110°F.
- **Sweet potatoes** — Underground and happy. Water occasionally.
- **Peppers** — Slowed but alive, especially hot peppers. Some gardeners pull peppers in July and replant in August. Others carry them through. Both work.
- **Yard-long beans** — Still producing.
- **Southern peas** — Still producing.
- **Malabar spinach** — Loves this weather.
- **Basil** — If watered regularly, basil thrives in summer heat.

Everything else is either dead, dying, or wishing it were.

## Start Fall Transplants Indoors

**This is the most important task of July.** Starting fall transplants indoors now gives them a head start so they're ready to go in the ground in August when conditions are still tough outside.

**Start indoors in July:**
- **Tomatoes** — Start July 1–15 for August transplant. Yes, you're growing tomatoes again. Fall tomatoes in Texas are often better than spring ones.
- **Peppers** — Start July 1–15 (or carry over spring plants)
- **Eggplant** — Start July 1–15
- **Broccoli** — Start July 1–15 for September transplant
- **Cauliflower** — Start July 1–15 for September transplant
- **Cabbage** — Start July 1–15 for September transplant
- **Brussels sprouts** — Start July 1 (they need a long season)

Grow them under lights indoors where temperatures are 70–75°F. They'll be ready to harden off and transplant in 6–8 weeks.

> **Pro Tip:** Fall tomatoes are Texas's best-kept secret. They produce in cooler fall temperatures when fruit set is easier, pest pressure is lower, and the days are getting shorter (which some varieties actually prefer). Many Texas gardeners get more tomatoes from their fall crop than their spring crop.

## Solarizing Empty Beds

July heat is good for one thing: cooking weeds, pathogens, and nematodes out of the soil.

**How to solarize:**
1. Water the empty bed thoroughly
2. Cover with clear plastic sheeting (not black — clear gets hotter)
3. Seal edges with soil, bricks, or boards
4. Leave for 4–6 weeks (all of July into August)
5. Remove plastic and plant directly — no tilling needed

Solarization can raise soil temperatures to 130–140°F under the plastic, killing weed seeds, root-knot nematodes, and many soilborne pathogens. It's free, chemical-free, and works beautifully in Texas.

## Soil Amendments for Fall Beds

While solarizing or resting beds, get your soil ready for fall:
- Add 3–4 inches of compost to beds that have been producing all spring
- Test soil if it's been more than 2 years
- Apply amendments recommended by your soil test
- Let everything settle for 2–3 weeks before fall planting

## Summer Garden Maintenance

The minimal summer to-do list:
- Water remaining crops deeply 2–3 times per week
- Harvest okra daily (it gets woody and tough at 5+ inches)
- Weed — yes, weeds still grow in July. Pull or hoe them before they set seed.
- Monitor for spider mites (tiny specks on leaf undersides, fine webbing — they thrive in hot, dry conditions). Blast with water or spray insecticidal soap.
- Stay hydrated. Wear a hat. Garden before 9 AM or after 6 PM. This is serious — heatstroke is real.

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** July and August are full dormancy. Water surviving crops. Stay inside.

**Gulf Coast:** Humidity is oppressive. Mosquitoes are legendary. Garden early morning only.

**Central Texas:** Peak heat. Solarize beds, start fall transplants, drink water.

**North Texas:** Similar to Central Texas. 100°F+ days are common. Maintain okra and peppers.

**West Texas:** Monsoon season may bring some afternoon thunderstorms — free water! Low humidity makes mornings more tolerable for garden work.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not starting fall transplants in July.** This is the #1 mistake. If you miss July, you miss the fall tomato window. Mark it on your calendar.
- **Neglecting beds.** Empty beds that aren't solarized or cover-cropped become weed nurseries.
- **Overwatering in panic.** Water deeply and less frequently. Don't keep the soil constantly soggy — that cooks roots in hot soil.
- **Gardening in the heat of the day.** Please don't. 6 AM to 9 AM. That's your window. Use it.

# Chapter 12: August — Fall Garden Launch

August is the most important month for Texas fall gardening, and it requires the most counterintuitive action in all of gardening: planting in the hottest month of the year.

It feels wrong. It looks wrong. It's 105°F outside and you're putting baby tomato transplants in the ground. But this is how you unlock Texas's second growing season — the one that many experienced gardeners consider the better of the two.

## Transplant Fall Tomatoes and Peppers

Your July-started transplants should be 6–8 inches tall and ready to harden off. The process is the same as spring, but with extra heat protection:

1. Harden off over 7–10 days (morning sun only at first — afternoon August sun will scorch tender transplants)
2. Transplant in the **late afternoon or evening** — never morning (they need overnight to recover, not a full day of blazing sun)
3. Bury tomato stems deep, just like spring
4. Water deeply at transplanting
5. **Shade cloth is mandatory** — 30–50% shade for the first 2–3 weeks
6. Mulch 4+ inches immediately

This feels like a lot of babying, and it is. But those transplants will establish roots over the next 3–4 weeks, and once September's slightly cooler temps arrive, they'll take off like rockets.

**Best fall tomato varieties for Texas:**
- Heat-set varieties that can set fruit above 90°F: Solar Fire, Phoenix, HeatMaster, Tycoon, Florida 91
- Once temps cool: Celebrity, Better Boy, Cherokee Purple (same varieties you grew in spring)

## Direct Sow: Round Two

August direct-sowing list:
- **Squash** — Plant early August for fall harvest. Squash vine borers are less active in fall.
- **Cucumbers** — Early August. They'll produce into October.
- **Beans** (snap and pole) — Direct sow through mid-August.
- **Southern peas** — One more round if planted early August.

Plant in the evening. Water immediately. Shade new seedlings with row cover or shade cloth until they're established.

## Start Cool-Season Transplants

If you didn't start these in July, do it NOW:
- Broccoli
- Cauliflower
- Cabbage
- Brussels sprouts
- Kale
- Collards

Start indoors under lights. They'll go outside in September–October.

## Dealing with Spider Mites and Heat Stress

August is peak spider mite season. These microscopic pests thrive in hot, dry conditions and can weaken or kill plants already stressed by heat.

**Signs:** Tiny yellow dots on leaves, fine webbing on undersides, leaves looking bronzed or dusty.

**Control:**
1. Blast with strong water spray (undersides of leaves!) every 2–3 days
2. Spray with insecticidal soap or neem oil in the morning or evening
3. Increase humidity around plants (misting, overhead watering just for mites — yes, breaking our own rule, but mites hate humidity)
4. Introduce predatory mites if the infestation is severe

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** Fall planting begins this month. Transplant tomatoes and peppers. Direct sow squash and beans. Shade cloth is essential.

**Gulf Coast:** Fall garden launch. Tropical storms are possible — protect transplants. Humidity helps suppress spider mites but encourages fungal diseases.

**Central Texas:** Peak fall planting month. Get everything in the ground or started by mid-August.

**North Texas:** Fall tomatoes go in by mid-August. Direct sow warm-season crops through August 15.

**West Texas:** Fall planting starts. Water availability may be limited — prioritize drip irrigation and mulch.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting until September to start the fall garden.** August is the critical month. September is too late for fall tomatoes in most of Texas.
- **Transplanting in the morning.** Evening transplanting gives plants all night to recover before facing the sun.
- **Skipping shade cloth.** August transplants without shade are like soldiers without armor. Cover them.
- **Giving up because it's hot.** The fall garden rewards courage. Three weeks of August misery pays off with three months of October–December harvests.

# Chapter 13: September — Fall Planting Push

September is when fall gardening gets fun. The worst of summer is finally breaking (even if "breaking" in Texas means high temperatures dropping from 102°F to a refreshing 94°F). Your August-planted tomatoes and peppers are establishing. And now it's time for the cool-season crops to go in.

September is to the fall garden what March is to the spring garden: the month where everything happens.

## Direct Sow Cool-Season Crops

Once soil temperatures start dropping below 85°F (usually mid to late September), it's time to direct sow:

- **Lettuce** — Every variety you love. Succession-plant every 2 weeks through November.
- **Spinach** — Direct sow. Loves cool weather. Will produce all winter with minimal protection.
- **Kale** — Direct sow or transplant. Gets sweeter after frost. Will produce for 6+ months.
- **Turnips** — Direct sow for both roots and greens. 45–60 days to harvest.
- **Beets** — Direct sow 1/2 inch deep. Thin to 3 inches apart. 55–70 days.
- **Carrots** — Direct sow in loose soil (raised beds are ideal). Keep soil moist until germination (7–14 days). Thin to 2 inches apart.
- **Radishes** — The instant gratification crop. 25–30 days from seed to plate. Sow every 2 weeks.
- **Swiss chard** — Direct sow or transplant. Gorgeous and productive. Handles heat and cold.

**The trick:** soil may still be too warm in early September, especially in South Texas and the Gulf Coast. If soil temperature is above 85°F, lettuce and spinach won't germinate well. Solutions: water the soil thoroughly before planting (cools it), plant in the afternoon, use shade cloth, and wait a week if needed.

## Transplant Cool-Season Crops

Your July/August-started transplants are ready:
- **Broccoli** — Transplant when plants have 4–6 true leaves. Space 18 inches apart. They need 60–80 days to mature.
- **Cauliflower** — Same timing as broccoli. More finicky about temperature — blanch the heads by tying leaves over the developing curd.
- **Cabbage** — Transplant 12–18 inches apart. 70–90 days to maturity.
- **Brussels sprouts** — Transplant September 1–15 (they need the longest season). Space 24 inches apart. Worth the wait.

## Herbs

September is the other great herb month:
- **Cilantro** — FINALLY. Direct sow now and it'll grow through winter without bolting. Fall cilantro is the best cilantro.
- **Dill** — Direct sow. Another cool-season herb that bolts in heat but thrives in fall.
- **Parsley** — Transplant or direct sow. Slow to germinate but lasts all winter.
- **Chives** — Transplant. Perennial and carefree.

## Fall Pest Management

Fall brings a different pest mix:
- **Cabbage loopers and imported cabbageworms** — Green caterpillars on brassicas. Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) spray is the organic gold standard — effective, specific to caterpillars, safe for everything else.
- **Leaf-footed bugs** — On tomatoes and peppers. Hand-pick adults, remove egg clusters.
- **Aphids** — They're back. Same controls as spring.
- **Armyworms** — Can devastate fall plantings. Bt or spinosad.

Row covers do double duty in fall — they keep pests off AND protect from early frost later. Worth installing at planting time and leaving on.

## Rain Returns — Adjust Watering

September and October often bring rain back to Texas (especially North and Central Texas). Adjust your irrigation:
- Reduce drip irrigation frequency after rainfall
- Monitor soil moisture — overwatering is as bad as underwatering
- Improve drainage in low spots before fall rains cause standing water
- Watch for fungal diseases in the humid post-rain conditions

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** Cool-season planting begins mid to late September. Direct sow greens. Transplant brassicas.

**Gulf Coast:** Fall tomatoes should be producing. Start cool-season plantings mid-September.

**Central Texas:** Peak fall planting. Everything goes in this month. Take advantage of September rains.

**North Texas:** Direct sow cool-season crops by September 15. Transplant brassicas early September. Fall tomatoes should be flowering.

**West Texas:** Fall planting in earnest. Shorter season means time is tight — prioritize fast-maturing varieties.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting too long to sow cool-season crops.** In Texas, September is the sweet spot. By November, the window has closed for most direct-sown crops.
- **Not protecting brassicas from caterpillars.** Row covers or Bt spray — pick one. Otherwise, the cabbage loopers will eat everything.
- **Overwatering after rain.** Turn off the drip system when it rains. Check the soil before irrigating.
- **Planting cilantro too early.** Wait until soil cools below 80°F. Hot soil = immediate bolting.

# Chapter 14: October — Cool Season Peak

October is when Texas gardening feels like a reward for surviving summer. Temperatures are dropping into the magical 70s–80s range. Fall tomatoes are ripening. Your cool-season crops are thriving. The garden is lush, productive, and — unlike spring — you don't have a wall of heat bearing down on you.

This is the month to plant garlic, continue sowing greens, and enjoy one of the best growing months on the Texas calendar.

## Continue Planting Greens and Root Vegetables

October is still prime time for direct sowing:
- Lettuce (succession plant every 2 weeks)
- Spinach
- Radishes
- Arugula
- Turnips
- Mustard greens
- Beets (early October — last call for most of Texas)
- Carrots (early October — they need time before cold weather)

## Garlic Planting: The Columbus Day Tradition

Just as potatoes go in on Valentine's Day, garlic goes in around Columbus Day (mid-October). Garlic needs a period of cold to form bulbs properly, so fall planting is essential.

**How to plant garlic in Texas:**

1. Buy **seed garlic** from a reputable supplier (not grocery store garlic, which is often treated or wrong variety for Texas). Order in August/September — it sells out.
2. Separate the bulb into individual cloves. Use only the largest, healthiest cloves.
3. Plant cloves pointed end UP, 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart.
4. Mulch with 3–4 inches of straw.
5. Water regularly through fall and winter.
6. Harvest in May when the bottom 3–4 leaves have turned brown.

**Best garlic varieties for Texas:**
- **Softneck varieties** (better for Texas's mild winters): Inchelium Red, California Early, Silver Rose
- **Hardneck varieties** (more flavor, need more cold): Chesnok Red, Music, German White — best for North Texas and the Hill Country where winters are colder

Garlic is one of the lowest-maintenance crops you can grow. Plant it, mulch it, forget about it until spring.

## Onion Planning

Texas and onions go way back. The Texas 1015 Supersweet was literally developed at Texas A&M for Texas growing conditions, and it's one of the mildest, sweetest onions you'll ever eat.

**October is onion planning month:**
- Decide on varieties: 1015 Supersweet, Texas Legend, Red Creole, Yellow Granex
- Order onion transplants (small plants, not sets or seeds) for November–January planting
- Short-day varieties ONLY for Texas (long-day onions won't bulb at our latitude)

We'll plant them in November (Chapter 15), but ordering now ensures you get the varieties you want.

## First Fall Harvests

Your August and September plantings are starting to produce:
- **Fall tomatoes** — ripening now. Enjoy the superior flavor that cooler nights bring.
- **Fall peppers** — producing vigorously.
- **Beans** — fall crop producing.
- **Squash** — fall round is coming in.
- **Broccoli** — early-planted may start heading.
- **Lettuce and greens** — harvesting leaves.
- **Radishes** — if you planted in September, they're ready.

## Cover Crops for Empty Beds

Plant winter cover crops in any beds you won't be using this fall:
- **Crimson clover** — Fixes nitrogen, gorgeous spring flowers, suppresses weeds. Sow October–November.
- **Winter rye (cereal rye)** — Deep roots break up compacted soil. Massive organic matter when turned in. Sow October–November.
- **Austrian winter peas** — Fix nitrogen, easy to manage. Sow October.
- **Hairy vetch** — Nitrogen fixer, vigorous growth. Sow October.

## Frost Date Awareness

North Texas and West Texas gardeners: your first frost is approaching (November 5–15). Start watching overnight lows by late October. Have row covers and frost cloth ready. You don't need them yet (probably), but be prepared.

For the rest of the state, frost isn't a concern yet, but having row covers on hand is smart. A freak early cold front can always surprise you.

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** Cool-season garden is in full swing. Plant everything. Frost is months away.

**Gulf Coast:** Peak fall planting and harvest. Long season ahead.

**Central Texas:** Excellent gardening weather. Plant garlic, continue cool-season crops.

**North Texas:** Plant garlic. Get cool-season transplants established before frost. Monitor forecasts.

**West Texas:** First frost may come late October. Plant garlic, sow fast-maturing greens. Row covers ready.

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping garlic.** It's the easiest, most rewarding crop to grow, and October is the only time to plant it.
- **Not ordering onion transplants early.** The good Texas varieties sell out. Order in October for November/January planting.
- **Ignoring cover crops.** Empty winter beds lose organic matter and grow weeds. Cover crops are free fertility.
- **Not watching frost dates in North/West Texas.** Don't let the first frost catch you off guard.

---

# Chapter 15: November — Late Fall and First Frost

November is a month of transition — from the glory of fall gardening into the quieter rhythms of winter. North Texas gets its first frost. Central Texas starts watching the forecast. South Texas and the Gulf Coast barely notice.

The garden is still producing, and there's still planting to do. But the pace is changing, and your focus shifts toward protection and preservation.

## Plant Onion Transplants

November through January is onion planting time in Texas. The earlier you plant, the larger your onions will be (within reason — they need some cold to bulb properly).

**How to plant onions:**
1. Buy short-day onion transplants (not sets, not seeds — transplants give the best results for Texas)
2. Trim roots to 1 inch and tops to 4–5 inches
3. Plant 1 inch deep, 4–6 inches apart, in rows 12 inches apart
4. Water well and mulch between rows
5. Feed every 3 weeks with nitrogen-rich fertilizer (21-0-0 or similar) until bulbing begins in spring

**Best varieties:**
- **Texas 1015 Supersweet** — THE Texas onion. Mild, sweet, massive. Plant November–January.
- **Texas Legend** — Another sweet variety, good disease resistance.
- **Red Creole** — Short-day red onion, great for fresh eating.
- **Yellow Granex** — The Vidalia-type. Grows beautifully in Texas.

## Protect Tender Crops from First Freeze

When the forecast shows temperatures below 32°F, it's time to protect:

**Hardy crops (survive 20s°F):** Kale, collards, spinach, turnips, garlic, onions. These don't need protection unless temperatures drop into the teens.

**Semi-hardy crops (survive light frost to 28°F):** Lettuce, chard, beets, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower. Protect with row cover during hard freezes (below 28°F).

**Tender crops (damaged by any frost):** Tomatoes, peppers, beans, squash. Cover with row cover or harvest everything if a hard freeze is coming.

**For a light frost (28–32°F):** A layer of row cover is sufficient.

**For a hard freeze (below 28°F):** Row cover plus an additional blanket, or row cover with Christmas lights underneath for supplemental heat.

## Harvest Sweet Potatoes Before Hard Frost

Sweet potatoes must be harvested before temperatures drop below 28°F — cold soil ruins the tubers.

**How to harvest:**
1. Cut the vines back to the ground
2. Use a digging fork (not a shovel — you'll slice tubers) to gently lift tubers from 12–18 inches around the plant
3. Brush off soil — don't wash them
4. **Cure** for 10–14 days in a warm (80–85°F), humid location. A garage, shed, or warm room works. This heals cuts and converts starches to sugars.
5. Store cured sweet potatoes in a cool (55–60°F), dark place. They'll keep for 6+ months.

## Fall/Winter Greens Under Row Covers

With row covers or cold frames, you can harvest greens all winter in Texas:

- **Kale** — The winter king. Actually gets sweeter after frost as cold converts starches to sugars. Harvest outer leaves continuously.
- **Collards** — Same cold tolerance as kale. A Southern classic.
- **Spinach** — Thrives in cold. Under row cover, it'll produce through January in most of Texas.
- **Lettuce** — Needs more protection than kale but grows all winter under row cover or in a cold frame.
- **Swiss chard** — Handles light frost. Cover during hard freezes.

## Garden Cleanup

November is time to put the spring/summer garden to bed:
- Remove dead tomato, pepper, and squash plants. Compost healthy ones; trash diseased ones (don't compost diseases).
- Clean and store cages, stakes, and trellises.
- Rake up fallen fruit to reduce pest overwintering sites.
- Add 2–3 inches of compost to empty beds as a winter top-dressing.
- Mulch generously.

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** No frost concerns yet. Cool-season garden is thriving. Plant onions. Continue harvesting.

**Gulf Coast:** Light frost possible by late November. Protect tender crops. Greens and brassicas producing well.

**Central Texas:** First frost usually mid-to-late November. Prepare protection. Heavy planting of greens and root vegetables.

**North Texas:** First frost by November 5–15. Protect or harvest tender crops. Hardy crops under row cover continue.

**West Texas:** Frost and freeze likely. Protect crops. Short fall season wrapping up.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not curing sweet potatoes.** Uncured sweet potatoes taste starchy, have shorter shelf life, and are more prone to rot. The curing step is essential.
- **Panicking about frost.** Hardy crops laugh at frost. Know which crops are hardy, semi-hardy, and tender, and protect accordingly.
- **Skipping onion planting.** Texas-grown onions are worth every bit of the November–January effort.
- **Leaving dead plants in the garden.** They harbor pests and diseases over winter. Clean up now.

# Chapter 16: December — Winter Gardening and Reflection

December in the Texas vegetable garden is quiet — but it's not dead. Under row covers and in cold frames, greens are growing. Garlic is rooting. Onions are establishing. And you, the gardener, have earned a moment to sit back, sip something warm, and think about what just happened.

## Winter Greens Harvest

If you've been following along since September, you should have a winter garden producing:

- **Kale** — Harvest once or twice a week. Cold makes it sweeter.
- **Collards** — Same deal. Classic Southern winter green.
- **Spinach** — Cut outer leaves or harvest the whole plant.
- **Lettuce** — Under row cover, still crisp and perfect.
- **Turnip greens** — Fast-growing and cold-hardy.
- **Mustard greens** — Spicy, cold-tolerant, prolific.

There's something deeply satisfying about stepping out on a 40°F December morning and picking salad greens from your own garden while your neighbors are buying limp lettuce at the grocery store.

## Garden Journaling and Record-Keeping

December is reflection time. Pull out a notebook (or open the notes app on your phone) and record:

- What varieties you grew and how they performed
- Planting dates and harvest dates
- What pests you dealt with and what worked
- What you'd do differently next year
- Yields (even rough estimates)
- Expenses

This information is invaluable for next year's planning. You'll forget the details by March if you don't write them down now.

## Seed Catalog Review and Ordering

Seed catalogs start arriving in December (if you're on mailing lists) and are available online year-round. This is the fun part:

- Browse new varieties
- Compare what's available from Texas-friendly seed companies
- Make your wish list for spring
- Order by early January for best selection

## Tool Maintenance

Your tools worked hard this year. Clean them:
- Scrub soil off shovels, trowels, and hoes
- Sharpen blades (pruners, hoes, shovels) with a flat file
- Oil metal surfaces with a light coat of mineral oil or WD-40
- Replace cracked handles
- Drain and store hoses and drip irrigation components (if in freeze-prone areas)

## Cold Frame Gardening

If you built or bought a cold frame, December is when it shines. Inside a cold frame:
- Lettuce grows slowly but steadily
- Spinach produces through the coldest months
- Carrots can be harvested fresh (they're fine in the ground, getting sweeter with cold)
- Herbs like parsley and chives stay productive

Open the cold frame on sunny days when interior temps exceed 70°F. Close it in the afternoon before sunset to trap heat overnight.

## Planning Next Year's Garden Layout

With the year's results fresh in your mind, sketch out next year's plan:
- Rotate crops (refer to Chapter 4's rotation plan)
- Consider expanding (or right-sizing — maybe you don't need six tomato plants)
- Plan infrastructure improvements (more raised beds? Better irrigation? Shade structure?)
- Budget for seeds, soil, and supplies

## Regional Notes

**South Texas:** Cool-season garden at peak production. December is one of the best gardening months in the Valley.

**Gulf Coast:** Mild winter keeps gardens going. Protect from occasional cold fronts.

**Central Texas:** Hard freezes possible. Row covers and cold frames are working. Continue harvesting hardy crops.

**North Texas:** Coldest month. Cold frames and row covers keep the hardiest crops going. Focus on indoor planning.

**West Texas:** Hard freezes likely. Cold frame gardening is about all that's active. Plan for spring.

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming the garden is done.** With minimal protection, Texas gardens produce fresh food 12 months a year.
- **Not journaling.** You think you'll remember what you planted and when. You won't. Write it down.
- **Neglecting cold frames.** They need ventilation on warm days. An overheated cold frame will cook your plants faster than a December freeze will.
- **Not ordering seeds in December/January.** The best varieties sell out. Early bird gets the 'Brandywine.'

# Chapter 17: Warm-Season Vegetables A–Z

## Beans (Snap, Lima, and Yard-Long)

Beans are one of the easiest and most rewarding crops for Texas gardens. They germinate fast, grow quickly, and fix nitrogen in the soil, improving it for the next crop.

### Snap Beans (Green Beans)

**Varieties for Texas:**
- **Bush types:** Blue Lake 274 (classic), Contender (heat-tolerant), Provider (cold-tolerant — good for early spring)
- **Pole types:** Kentucky Wonder, Rattlesnake (heat-tolerant heirloom), Blue Lake Pole

**Planting dates:**
| Region | Spring | Fall |
|--------|--------|------|
| North Texas | March 15–April 30 | August 1–15 |
| Central Texas | March 1–April 15 | August 1–20 |
| Gulf Coast | February 15–April 1 | August 15–September 1 |
| South Texas | February 1–March 15 | September 1–15 |
| West Texas | April 1–May 15 | August 1–15 |

**Spacing:** Bush beans: 4–6 inches apart, rows 18–24 inches apart. Pole beans: 6 inches apart, rows 36 inches apart with trellis.

**Days to maturity:** 50–65 days (bush), 60–75 days (pole)

**Growing tips:**
- Don't start indoors — beans don't transplant well. Direct sow only.
- Inoculate with rhizobium bacteria at planting for better nitrogen fixation (optional but helpful in new garden beds)
- Don't over-fertilize — too much nitrogen = lots of leaves, few beans
- Water at soil level to prevent rust and mildew

**Common problems:**
- **Bean beetles** — Copper-colored beetles that skeletonize leaves. Hand-pick or spray with neem.
- **Rust** — Orange spots on leaves. Avoid overhead watering. Remove affected plants.
- **Poor pollination in extreme heat** — Blossoms drop above 95°F. Plant early enough to avoid peak summer.

**Harvest:** Pick snap beans when pencil-thick, before seeds bulge visibly in the pod. Regular picking encourages continued production. A single bush bean plant can produce 1/2 pound over its life; pole beans produce 2–3x more.

### Lima Beans

**Best varieties:** Henderson Bush (small), Fordhook 242 (large), Jackson Wonder (heat-tolerant butter bean)

Lima beans need warmer soil than snap beans (70°F+). Plant 2–3 weeks after snap beans. They're slower to mature (75–90 days) but incredibly productive in Texas heat.

### Yard-Long Beans (Asparagus Beans)

**Best varieties:** Red Noodle, Green Pod, Mosaic (purple)

The secret weapon of Texas summer gardening. Yard-long beans thrive in temperatures that kill conventional beans. They're vigorous pole beans that produce 18-inch pods (despite the name, they don't actually reach a yard). Plant after soil reaches 70°F+. Provide a strong trellis — they're heavy producers.

---

## Corn

There's nothing like fresh sweet corn from the garden, but corn is a space hog and requires some planning.

**Varieties for Texas:**
- **Sweet corn:** Peaches and Cream (bicolor, reliable), Silver Queen (white, classic), Honey Select (supersweet), Ambrosia (bicolor)
- **Roasting corn:** Stowell's Evergreen, Country Gentleman
- **Flour corn:** Hopi Blue (drought-tolerant, excellent for West Texas)

**Planting dates:**
| Region | Spring |
|--------|--------|
| North Texas | March 15–April 15 |
| Central Texas | March 1–April 1 |
| Gulf Coast | February 15–March 15 |
| South Texas | February 1–March 1 |
| West Texas | April 1–15 |

**Spacing:** 12 inches apart in rows 30 inches apart. **Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows** — corn is wind-pollinated and needs neighboring plants for good ear development.

**Days to maturity:** 60–90 days depending on variety.

**Growing tips:**
- Heavy feeder — side-dress with nitrogen when plants are 12 inches tall and again when tassels appear
- Needs consistent moisture, especially during tasseling and silking
- Succession-plant every 2 weeks for 3 plantings (or you'll have 100 ears at once and none later)

**Common problems:**
- **Corn earworm** — Apply mineral oil to silk tips after pollination, or use Bt spray
- **Poor ear fill** — From insufficient pollination. Plant in blocks, not single rows.
- **Raccoons** — They know exactly when your corn is ready. One day before you do.

**Harvest:** When silks turn brown and dry, peel back a small section of husk to check. Kernels should be plump and release milky juice when punctured. Cook immediately — sugar starts converting to starch within hours of picking.

---

## Cowpeas / Black-Eyed Peas

The quintessential Southern crop, and perfectly adapted to Texas heat.

**Varieties:** Texas Pinkeye Purple Hull (the classic), Queen Anne, Mississippi Silver, Zipper Cream, California Blackeye #5

**Planting dates:** After soil reaches 70°F — April through July for most of Texas. These can be planted later than most crops because they handle summer heat.

**Spacing:** 4 inches apart, rows 36 inches apart.

**Days to maturity:** 60–80 days.

**Growing tips:**
- Drought-tolerant once established
- Fix nitrogen — no nitrogen fertilizer needed
- Minimal pest problems
- Can be harvested as fresh (shell) peas or left to dry on the vine for dried peas

**Harvest:** For fresh shelling: pick when pods are filled but still slightly flexible. For dried: leave on vine until pods are papery and dry. Shell and store.

---

## Cucumbers

Cucumbers are prolific in Texas spring and fall, but they don't love extreme heat.

**Varieties:**
- **Slicing:** Straight Eight, Marketmore 76, Diva (all-female for heavy production), Tasty Green
- **Pickling:** National Pickling, Boston Pickling, Calypso
- **Specialty:** Armenian (actually a melon — extremely heat-tolerant, perfect for Texas summer)

**Planting dates:**
| Region | Spring | Fall |
|--------|--------|------|
| North Texas | March 15–April 15 | August 1–15 |
| Central Texas | March 1–April 1 | August 1–20 |
| Gulf Coast | February 15–March 15 | August 15–Sept 1 |
| South Texas | February 1–March 1 | September |
| West Texas | April 1–15 | August 1–10 |

**Spacing:** 12 inches apart on a trellis, or 36 inches apart if growing on the ground.

**Days to maturity:** 50–65 days.

**Growing tips:**
- Trellis them. Saves space, produces cleaner fruit, reduces disease.
- Consistent watering is critical — irregular watering causes bitter fruit.
- Mulch heavily.
- Armenian cucumbers are the best hot-weather substitute if regular cucumbers fail.

**Common problems:**
- **Powdery mildew** — White coating on leaves. Improve airflow, spray neem or potassium bicarbonate.
- **Cucumber beetles** — Spread bacterial wilt. Row cover until flowering, then hand-pick or use yellow sticky traps.
- **Bitter fruit** — From heat or water stress. Water consistently.

**Harvest:** Pick slicing types at 6–8 inches, picklers at 2–4 inches. Harvest daily — oversized cucumbers are seedy and bitter, and leaving them on the vine signals the plant to stop producing.

---

## Eggplant

Eggplant loves Texas heat and is criminally underplanted in Texas gardens.

**Varieties:**
- **Globe:** Black Beauty (classic), Galine (early)
- **Asian/Japanese:** Ichiban, Ping Tung Long, Orient Express (all excellent for Texas — thin skin, fast-maturing)
- **Mini/specialty:** Fairy Tale, Little Fingers, Turkish Orange

**Planting dates:** Same as peppers. Transplant after last frost when soil is 65°F+.

**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart.

**Days to maturity:** 65–80 days from transplant.

**Growing tips:**
- More heat-tolerant than tomatoes — keeps producing through Texas summer
- Benefits from staking as fruit can be heavy
- Flea beetles love eggplant — use row cover until plants are established

**Common problems:**
- **Flea beetles** — Tiny holes in leaves. Row cover is best prevention.
- **Colorado potato beetle** — Hand-pick. Bt (San Diego strain) for larvae.
- **Fruit not setting** — Usually too cold (below 60°F night). In Texas, heat is rarely the problem.

**Harvest:** Pick when skin is glossy and firm. Dull skin means it's overripe and seedy. Cut with pruners — don't pull.

---

## Melons (Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Honeydew)

Texas is watermelon country. You've got the heat, the sun, and the long season. Melons thrive here.

### Watermelon

**Varieties:** Crimson Sweet (classic, 25 lbs), Sugar Baby (icebox, 8–10 lbs), Yellow Doll (yellow flesh), Jubilee, Charleston Gray, Congo

**Planting dates:** After soil reaches 70°F. March (South TX) through April (North TX).

**Spacing:** 6–8 feet between plants. Yes, really.

**Days to maturity:** 75–100 days.

**Growing tips:**
- Space hog — each plant needs 32+ square feet. Grow on the perimeter of the garden.
- Sandy soil produces sweeter melons. Amend clay soil heavily.
- Reduce watering as fruit matures — excess water dilutes flavor.
- Black plastic mulch warms soil and prevents fruit rot.

**Harvest:** Thump test (hollow sound = ripe), check the ground spot (should be creamy yellow, not white), and look for a dried tendril near the fruit stem.

### Cantaloupe/Muskmelon

**Varieties:** Hale's Best Jumbo (classic), Ambrosia (sweet), Athena (disease-resistant), Honey Rock

**Same planting dates and spacing as watermelon.** Days to maturity: 75–90 days.

**Harvest:** When the fruit "slips" — separates from the vine with gentle pressure. If you have to pull or cut, it's not ready.

### Honeydew

**Varieties:** Earlidew, Honey Brew, Green Flesh Honeydew

More finicky than cantaloupe. Needs a long, hot season — perfect for South and Central Texas. Harvest when the skin turns creamy and the blossom end gives slightly when pressed.

---

## Okra

Okra is the ultimate Texas summer vegetable. It laughs at 105°F. It produces for months. It's beautiful (the flowers look like tropical hibiscus). If you garden in Texas, grow okra.

**Varieties:**
- **Clemson Spineless** — The standard. Heavy producer, 4–5 feet tall.
- **Emerald** — Smooth pods, good for canning.
- **Burgundy** — Red pods that turn green when cooked. Beautiful plants.
- **Star of David** — Heirloom, fat ribbed pods, excellent flavor.
- **Jambalaya** — Compact (3–4 feet), good for small spaces and containers.

**Planting dates:** After soil reaches 70°F. April for most of Texas, May for late starters.

**Spacing:** 12–18 inches apart, rows 36 inches apart. Plants reach 4–8 feet tall.

**Days to maturity:** 55–65 days.

**Growing tips:**
- Soak seeds overnight before planting — the hard seed coat slows germination otherwise
- Nick the seed coat with a file for even faster germination
- Don't over-water once established — okra is drought-tolerant
- Wear gloves and long sleeves when harvesting — the leaves and pods have irritating spines (except Clemson Spineless, which is less prickly)

**Common problems:**
- **Root-knot nematodes** — Stunted plants, galled roots. Rotate crops, solarize soil.
- **Aphids** — Common on new growth. Blast with water.
- **Fire ants** — Build mounds at the base of plants. Treat with bait.

**Harvest:** Every 1–2 days when pods are 3–4 inches long. Bigger pods are tough and woody. You can't harvest too often — okra produces more when you pick more. A single plant can produce 50+ pods over the season.

---

## Peppers (Sweet and Hot)

Peppers are the second most popular Texas garden crop (after tomatoes) and arguably more reliable. They handle heat better, have fewer pest problems, and come in an incredible range of flavors, sizes, and heat levels.

### Sweet Peppers

**Varieties:**
- **Bell:** California Wonder (classic), Big Bertha, Gypsy (early), Sweet Banana
- **Specialty:** Cubanelle (frying pepper), Jimmy Nardello (Italian), Shishito (Japanese), Pimiento

### Hot Peppers

**Varieties:**
- **Mild heat:** Anaheim, Poblano/Ancho, NuMex Joe E. Parker
- **Medium heat:** Jalapeño (TAM Jalapeño for milder, Early Jalapeño for standard), Serrano, Hungarian Wax
- **Hot:** Cayenne, Thai Hot, Tabasco, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet
- **Extreme:** Carolina Reaper, Ghost Pepper (Bhut Jolokia), Trinidad Scorpion — these need a long season and thrive in Texas heat

**Planting dates:**
| Region | Spring | Fall |
|--------|--------|------|
| North Texas | March 15–April 15 | July transplant start, August plant out |
| Central Texas | March 1–15 | July transplant start, August plant out |
| Gulf Coast | February 15–March 15 | July transplant start, August plant out |
| South Texas | February 1–March 1 | August transplant start, September plant out |
| West Texas | April 1–15 | July transplant start, August plant out |

**Spacing:** 18–24 inches apart.

**Days to maturity:** 60–90 days from transplant (green stage). Add 2–4 weeks for full color.

**Growing tips:**
- Peppers set fruit best at 65–85°F. Above 95°F, blossom drop increases. Shade cloth extends production.
- Let bell peppers turn red (or orange, yellow, etc.) on the plant for maximum sweetness and nutrition. Green bells are just immature peppers.
- Side-dress with calcium (bone meal or gypsum) to prevent blossom end rot.
- Pinch the first few flowers on young transplants to encourage bushier growth.

**Common problems:**
- **Blossom end rot** — Dark, sunken spots on the bottom of fruit. Caused by calcium deficiency (often triggered by inconsistent watering). Water evenly; add calcium.
- **Sunscald** — White, papery patches from direct sun on fruit. More common in sparse-leaved plants. Shade cloth helps.
- **Aphids** — Standard controls.

**Harvest:** Pick peppers at any stage. Green peppers are perfectly edible; colored peppers are sweeter and more nutritious. Use pruners to cut — don't pull, which can break branches.

## Squash (Summer and Winter)

Squash is the crop Texas gardens produce in embarrassing abundance. You'll have more zucchini than you know what to do with — and your neighbors will start locking their car doors when they see you coming with a bag.

### Summer Squash

**Varieties:**
- **Zucchini:** Black Beauty, Costata Romanesco (Italian heirloom, amazing flavor), Dark Green
- **Yellow squash:** Yellow Crookneck, Straightneck, Goldbar
- **Specialty:** Pattypan/Scallop, Cousa (Middle Eastern), Tatume (Texas heirloom — extremely heat-tolerant and vine borer-resistant)

### Winter Squash

**Varieties:**
- **Butternut:** Waltham Butternut (classic), Honeynut (mini)
- **Acorn:** Table Queen, Carnival
- **Spaghetti squash:** Spaghetti, Orangetti
- **Others:** Seminole Pumpkin (incredibly heat and pest-resistant, perfect for Texas)

> **Pro Tip:** Tatume squash is a Texas heirloom that's far more heat-tolerant and vine-borer-resistant than standard varieties. It grows as a vine (needs trellising or lots of space) and produces round, green squash similar to zucchini in flavor. If squash vine borers have destroyed your conventional squash, try Tatume.

**Planting dates:** Same as cucumbers — spring (March–April) and fall (August).

**Spacing:** Bush types: 24–36 inches apart. Vine types: 4–6 feet apart (or trellis).

**Days to maturity:** Summer squash: 45–55 days. Winter squash: 80–110 days.

**Growing tips:**
- Squash needs bees for pollination. If you're not seeing fruit set, hand-pollinate with a paintbrush.
- Squash vine borers are the #1 enemy. Prevention strategies: row cover until flowering, wrap stems with foil, inject Bt into stems, plant resistant varieties (Tatume, butternut types, Seminole pumpkin).
- Summer squash: harvest small and often. Winter squash: leave on vine until skin is hard and stem is dry.

**Common problems:**
- **Squash vine borers** — Sawdust-like frass at the base of stems. By the time you see wilting, the damage is done. Prevention is key.
- **Powdery mildew** — Inevitable on squash. Neem or potassium bicarbonate spray helps. Some varieties have resistance.
- **Squash bugs** — Gray, shield-shaped bugs. Crush egg masses on leaf undersides. Trap under boards at night and destroy.

**Harvest:** Summer squash at 6–8 inches. Winter squash when skin can't be dented with a fingernail and the stem is dry. Cure winter squash in the sun for a week before storage.

---

## Sweet Potatoes

Sweet potatoes are one of the most productive, lowest-maintenance crops for Texas. Once established, they need almost no attention — just sun, heat, and occasional water.

**Varieties:**
- **Beauregard** — The standard. Orange flesh, high yields, 90 days.
- **Jewel** — Similar to Beauregard, slightly longer season.
- **Covington** — Excellent flavor, consistent shape.
- **Purple (Murasaki/Stokes Purple)** — Purple skin and/or flesh. Fun and nutritious.
- **White (O'Henry)** — Dry, starchy texture. Preferred in some cuisines.

**Planting dates:** April–May when soil is consistently 65°F+.

**Spacing:** 12–18 inches apart in rows 36 inches apart. Or in raised beds, 12–18 inches apart in all directions.

**Days to maturity:** 90–120 days.

**Growing tips:**
- Plant slips (rooted vine cuttings), not seed or chunks of tuber
- Bury slips leaving only the top 3–4 leaves exposed
- Water regularly for the first 2 weeks, then only during extended drought
- DO NOT fertilize with high nitrogen — you'll get enormous vines and tiny tubers
- Vines will sprawl everywhere. Let them. They shade the soil and reduce watering needs.

**Common problems:**
- **Sweet potato weevils** (South Texas primarily) — Rotate planting sites. Destroy all unharvested tubers.
- **Wireworms** — Bore into tubers. Rotate crops. Most common in recently tilled sod.
- **Cracking** — From uneven watering. Water consistently.

**Harvest:** 90–120 days after planting, or before the first hard frost (below 28°F). Cure at 80–85°F for 10–14 days. Store at 55–60°F for up to 6 months.

## Tomatoes

The reason most people start gardening. The crown jewel of the Texas vegetable garden. Also the crop most likely to break your heart when summer heat kills your plants just as they're hitting their stride.

Understanding tomato growing in Texas is understanding timing: you have a window, and it's narrower than you think.

### Types

**Determinate** (bush) tomatoes grow to a set size, produce all their fruit in a concentrated period (4–6 weeks), then decline. Good for: canning (all at once), small spaces, early harvest.

**Indeterminate** (vining) tomatoes grow continuously, producing fruit until disease or temperature stops them. Good for: extended harvest, fresh eating, maximum total yield.

For Texas, many gardeners plant both: determinates for a reliable early harvest, indeterminates for continued production.

### Varieties for Texas

**Heat-set varieties** (set fruit above 90°F):
- Solar Fire, Phoenix, HeatMaster, Tycoon, Florida 91, Heatwave II
- These are essential for fall planting when transplanting in August heat

**Standard varieties that do well in Texas:**
- Celebrity (semi-determinate, disease-resistant, all-purpose)
- Better Boy (indeterminate, classic slicer)
- Big Beef (indeterminate, large fruit)
- Early Girl (indeterminate, very early — plant for first-of-season bragging rights)
- Roma/San Marzano (determinate paste types — essential for sauce)
- Juliet (indeterminate grape, prolific, crack-resistant)
- Sun Gold (indeterminate cherry — the best-tasting cherry tomato on earth, fight me)
- Cherokee Purple (indeterminate heirloom, outstanding flavor)
- Brandywine (indeterminate heirloom — the gold standard for tomato flavor, but finicky)

### Planting Dates

| Region | Spring Transplant | Fall Transplant |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| North Texas | March 15–April 1 | July 15 start, August 10–20 plant out |
| Central Texas | March 1–15 | July 1 start, August 1–15 plant out |
| Gulf Coast | February 15–March 1 | July 1 start, August 1–15 plant out |
| South Texas | February 1–15 | August 1 start, September 1–15 plant out |
| West Texas | April 1–15 | July 1 start, August 1–15 plant out |

### Spacing

24–36 inches apart for indeterminates in cages. 18–24 inches for determinates. Rows 4–5 feet apart.

### Growing Tips

- **Bury deep.** Remove lower leaves and bury 2/3 of the stem. Tomatoes root along buried stems.
- **Cage or stake at planting.** Not later. Use heavy-gauge concrete reinforcing wire cages — the flimsy store-bought ones are useless for indeterminates.
- **Mulch heavily.** 4 inches minimum. Prevents soil splash (reduces disease) and conserves water.
- **Water consistently.** Irregular watering causes blossom end rot and cracking. 1–2 inches per week.
- **Prune indeterminates.** Remove suckers (side shoots between main stem and branches) below the first flower cluster. Above that, let them grow. This is debatable — some gardeners prune heavily, some don't prune at all. Either way, the world keeps turning.
- **Side-dress with fertilizer** when the first fruit sets, and again 2 weeks later. Tomatoes are moderate to heavy feeders.
- **Shade cloth in late spring/early fall** extends the production window by keeping temperatures below the critical 95°F threshold.

### Common Problems

- **Blossom end rot** — Dark, sunken bottom of fruit. Not a disease — it's calcium deficiency, usually from irregular watering. Water consistently, add calcium.
- **Cracking** — Fruit splits from sudden water after drought. Water evenly. Harvest early if rain is forecast.
- **Early blight** — Brown, concentric ring spots on lower leaves. Remove affected leaves, mulch to prevent soil splash, copper fungicide if severe.
- **Tomato hornworm** — Big green caterpillar. Hand-pick. If it has white cocoons on it, leave it — those are parasitic wasp eggs, and those wasps are your friends. Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) works as a spray.
- **Blossom drop** — Flowers fall off without setting fruit. Usually heat-related. Night temperatures above 75°F or day temps above 95°F prevent pollination. Plant heat-set varieties for fall. In spring, race to get fruit set before the heat arrives.
- **Leaf curl** — Can be viral (yellow leaf curl virus, spread by whiteflies) or physiological from heat/water stress. If viral, remove and destroy the plant. If stress-related, improve conditions and wait it out.

### Harvest Tips

Pick tomatoes when they're fully colored, or harvest at the "breaker" stage (first blush of color) and ripen indoors. Once a tomato starts turning, it will develop full flavor off the vine. This is actually better for the plant — it redirects energy to ripening the remaining fruit.

Don't refrigerate fresh tomatoes. Ever. Cold destroys the volatile compounds that give tomatoes their flavor. Store at room temperature and eat within a few days.

And yes, there's nothing on earth like a warm tomato eaten straight off the vine, standing in your garden in your pajamas at 7 AM. That's not gardening advice — that's life advice.

# Chapter 18: Cool-Season Vegetables A–Z

Cool-season crops are the unsung heroes of the Texas garden. While everyone obsesses over tomatoes (guilty as charged), the cool-season garden — fall through spring — is actually *easier* and more productive in most of Texas. Fewer pests, less water stress, and moderate temperatures mean less babysitting and more harvesting.

The key to cool-season success in Texas: timing. Plant too early in fall and the heat kills your seedlings. Plant too late and a hard freeze takes them out before they mature. The sweet spot varies by region, so pay close attention to the planting dates below.

## Beets

Beets are criminally underplanted in Texas gardens. They're easy, fast, and you get two crops in one — the roots *and* the greens.

### Varieties for Texas

- Detroit Dark Red (classic, reliable)
- Chioggia (candy-striped interior — gorgeous in salads)
- Golden (milder flavor, doesn't stain everything it touches)
- Bull's Blood (grown primarily for the stunning dark red greens)

### Planting Dates

Direct sow in fall (September 15–October 15 for most of Texas) and late winter (February 1–March 1). Beet "seeds" are actually clusters of 2–4 seeds, so you'll need to thin. Soak seeds overnight for better germination.

### Spacing & Care

Thin to 3–4 inches apart, rows 12 inches apart. Keep soil consistently moist. Beets are light feeders but appreciate a side-dressing of compost mid-season.

### Harvest

50–60 days. Pull when roots are 2–3 inches across. Larger beets get woody and lose sweetness. Don't throw out the greens — sauté them with garlic and olive oil.

---

## Broccoli & Cauliflower

These brassica cousins are cool-season royalty, but they're also the divas of the vegetable garden. They demand consistent cool weather, rich soil, and protection from both heat and hard freezes. Is it worth the effort? Absolutely — homegrown broccoli tastes nothing like the sad, rubbery stalks from the grocery store.

### Varieties for Texas

**Broccoli:**
- Waltham 29 (open-pollinated, great side-shoot production)
- Green Magic (early, tolerates mild heat)
- Calabrese (classic Italian heirloom)
- Belstar (reliable hybrid)

**Cauliflower:**
- Snowball (the standard white)
- Amazing (heat-tolerant for Texas)
- Cheddar (orange, higher beta-carotene, conversation starter)
- Graffiti (purple — turns green when cooked, which is both cool and slightly disappointing)

### Planting Dates

Start transplants 6–8 weeks before planting out. For fall: transplant into the garden September 15–October 15 (North/Central TX) or October 1–November 1 (Gulf Coast/South TX). For spring: transplant February 1–March 1, but spring timing is tight — you're racing against the heat.

### Spacing & Care

18–24 inches apart, rows 30–36 inches. Heavy feeders — amend beds with compost and fertilize every 2–3 weeks. Consistent water is critical. Cauliflower heads need blanching (fold outer leaves over the head) unless you're growing a self-blanching variety.

### Common Problems

- Cabbage loopers and imported cabbage worms — Bt is your best organic option. Row covers prevent moths from laying eggs in the first place.
- Bolting — both crops bolt (flower prematurely) when temperatures stay above 80°F. Timing is everything.
- Hollow stem — from too much nitrogen or rapid growth. Moderate your fertilizing.

### Harvest

Cut the main head when florets are tight and before any yellow flowers show. Broccoli will produce side shoots for weeks after the main head is cut. Cauliflower is one-and-done — cut the head and pull the plant.

---

## Brussels Sprouts

Let's be honest: Brussels sprouts are a gamble in most of Texas. They need a *long* cool season (90–100 days from transplant), and Texas doesn't always cooperate. That said, North Texas and the Hill Country can pull it off with fall planting.

### Varieties for Texas

- Long Island Improved (compact, reliable)
- Jade Cross (hybrid, good heat tolerance)
- Diablo (earlier maturing — important for Texas)

### Planting Dates

Transplant in September for a December–January harvest. Start seeds indoors in July (yes, the hottest month — they'll need protection from the heat).

### Spacing & Growing Tips

24 inches apart. Tall plants may need staking. Remove lower leaves as sprouts develop. A light frost actually *improves* the flavor — it converts starches to sugars.

### Harvest

Pick sprouts from the bottom up when they're 1–1.5 inches across and still tight. Twist or cut them off. In a good year, one plant yields 50–100 sprouts. In a bad year, you have a very impressive-looking plant that produces marbles. That's gardening.

---

## Cabbage

Cabbage is one of the most reliable cool-season crops in Texas. It's tough, productive, and unfazed by light frost. Plus, homemade coleslaw and sauerkraut are legitimate life upgrades.

### Varieties for Texas

- Early Jersey Wakefield (pointed head, early, handles heat better)
- Golden Acre (compact heads, good for small gardens)
- Savoy Ace (crinkled leaves, beautiful, tender)
- Red Acre (red/purple, gorgeous in the garden and on the plate)
- Napa/Chinese cabbage (fast-growing, great for stir-fry, fall only)

### Planting Dates

Transplant February–March for spring, September–October for fall. Fall crops generally do better in Texas.

### Spacing & Harvest

12–18 inches apart. Harvest when heads are firm and full-sized. Cut at the base, leaving the outer wrapper leaves. 60–100 days from transplant depending on variety.

---

## Carrots

Carrots are easy in theory but require actual good soil to succeed — which is a tall order in much of Texas. If you have clay, grow them in raised beds with loose, sandy loam. Trying to grow carrots in hard clay is an exercise in growing forked, stubby little root sculptures.

### Varieties for Texas

- Danvers Half Long (tolerates heavier soil better than most)
- Nantes (sweet, cylindrical, great all-purpose)
- Chantenay (short and stout — good for clay-adjacent soil)
- Little Finger (small, perfect for containers)

### Planting Dates

Direct sow September–November for fall/winter harvest, or January–February for spring. Carrots need cool soil for germination — above 80°F and they won't sprout. In early fall, shade the seeded area until germination.

### Tips

Keep the seed bed consistently moist until germination (10–21 days — patience required). Thin to 2–3 inches apart. Mulch to keep roots cool and prevent green shoulders. Sandy loam is ideal. Heavy clay is not.

### Harvest

60–80 days. Pull a test carrot to check size. Water the bed before pulling to make harvesting easier. Carrots sweeten after frost exposure — leave some in the ground through winter for sugar-bomb carrots in January.

---

## Collards & Kale

If you're not growing greens in your Texas fall/winter garden, you're missing the easiest, most nutritious thing you can grow. Collards and kale are practically indestructible, tolerate both light frost and moderate heat, and keep producing for months.

### Varieties for Texas

**Collards:**
- Georgia Southern (the classic, huge leaves, vigorous)
- Vates (compact, uniform, good for smaller spaces)
- Champion (slower to bolt)

**Kale:**
- Lacinato/Dinosaur (dark, bumpy leaves, sweetest flavor, the fancy one)
- Red Russian (flat leaves, purple stems, gorgeous)
- Winterbor (frilly, cold-hardy, very productive)
- Curly Scotch (classic curly kale — hardiest of them all)

### Planting Dates

Transplant or direct sow August–October for fall/winter. Can also plant February–March for spring, but fall is superior — they'll produce through winter.

### Spacing & Care

18–24 inches apart. Remove lower leaves as the plant grows (harvest from the bottom up, leaving the growing crown). Feed monthly with balanced fertilizer. These are cut-and-come-again crops — one planting feeds you for months.

### Harvest

Pick outer leaves when they're 8–12 inches long. Young leaves are more tender; larger leaves are better for cooking. Kale and collards both improve in flavor after frost. A well-mulched kale plant in Central Texas can produce from October through April.

---

## Garlic

Garlic is ridiculously easy in Texas and infinitely better than store-bought. The catch: you plant it in fall and don't harvest until late spring. Patience, grasshopper.

### Types for Texas

- **Softneck** varieties (Artichoke types like California Early, Inchelium Red) — better for mild-winter areas like Gulf Coast and South Texas. Long storage life, great for braiding.
- **Hardneck** varieties (Rocambole, Purple Stripe) — need more cold chill, better for North Texas and Hill Country. Produce scapes (curly flower stalks) that are delicious sautéed.
- **Elephant garlic** — technically a leek, not true garlic, but it's easy to grow and mild-flavored.

### Planting

Plant individual cloves October–November, pointed end up, 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart. Mulch heavily (4–6 inches). That's it. Walk away. Check back in April.

### Harvest

When the bottom 3–4 leaves have browned (usually May–June), dig up a test bulb. If the cloves fill the skin, harvest by loosening soil with a fork and pulling. Cure in a shaded, dry area for 2–3 weeks before storing.

## Lettuce & Salad Greens

Lettuce is the perfect beginner crop for Texas cool-season gardening. It grows fast, takes up little space, and you can start harvesting baby greens in as little as 30 days.

### Varieties for Texas

- Black Seeded Simpson (loose-leaf, bolt-resistant, fast)
- Buttercrunch (butterhead, sweet and tender)
- Jericho (romaine, bred in Israel — heat-tolerant)
- Red Sails (loose-leaf, beautiful red color)
- Mesclun mixes (variety of greens in one packet — lazy and brilliant)
- Arugula (technically not lettuce, technically don't care — it's peppery and delicious)

### Planting Dates

Direct sow or transplant September–November for fall/winter, January–March for spring. Succession plant every 2–3 weeks for continuous harvest.

### Tips

Lettuce has shallow roots — water frequently but lightly. Shade cloth extends the season on both ends. In winter, a simple row cover protects from hard freezes while keeping plants growing. Harvest outer leaves (cut-and-come-again) or cut the whole head at the base.

## Onions (and Texas 1015 SuperSweets!)

If there's one crop that defines Texas vegetable gardening, it's the onion. Specifically, the Texas 1015 SuperSweet — a mild, sweet, enormous onion developed at Texas A&M specifically for our growing conditions. If you've never grown onions, start with these. They're basically foolproof.

### Types and Day-Length

This is critical: onions are categorized by **day-length** — short-day, intermediate-day, and long-day. Texas gardeners must grow **short-day varieties** (or intermediate-day in North Texas). Long-day onions will not form bulbs in Texas.

### Varieties for Texas

- Texas 1015 SuperSweet (THE Texas onion, short-day, sweet, huge)
- Texas Legend (short-day, disease-resistant)
- Red Burgundy (short-day, gorgeous red)
- Yellow Granex (Vidalia-type, short-day, sweet)
- Candy (intermediate-day, works in North Texas)

### Planting

Plant transplants (little seedlings) or sets in November–February, depending on your region. Transplants give the best results. Space 4–6 inches apart in rows, or 4 inches apart in all directions in raised beds. Plant so just the roots and bottom inch are buried.

### Care

Feed every 2–3 weeks with nitrogen-heavy fertilizer until bulbing begins (usually March/April). Stop fertilizing once you see bulbs swelling. Keep weeded — onions have shallow roots and compete poorly with weeds.

### Harvest

When the tops fall over naturally (May–June), stop watering and let them cure in the ground for a few days. Pull, let dry in a shaded area for 1–2 weeks, then store. Sweet onions don't store as long as pungent types — eat them within 1–2 months or refrigerate.

---

## Peas (English, Snap, and Snow)

Peas are cool-season sprinters. They grow fast, produce beautifully, and then they're done. In Texas, the window is tight — plant too late in spring and the heat shuts them down; plant too late in fall and frost gets them. But when you nail the timing, fresh peas straight from the vine are pure joy.

### Varieties for Texas

- Sugar Snap (snap pea, edible pod, sweet, classic)
- Oregon Sugar Pod (snow pea, flat edible pod)
- Green Arrow (shelling pea, reliable, high-yielding)
- Wando (shelling pea, more heat-tolerant than most)

### Planting Dates

Direct sow January–February for spring, October–November for fall (Gulf Coast and South TX). Peas prefer soil temps of 40–75°F. Inoculate seeds with rhizobium bacteria for better nitrogen fixation.

### Spacing & Support

Sow 2 inches apart, rows 18–24 inches. Most peas need a trellis or support — even "bush" types benefit from something to lean on. A simple string trellis or chicken wire works great.

### Harvest

Pick snap and snow peas when pods are plump but before seeds inside get large and starchy. For shelling peas, wait until pods are fat and round. Pick frequently to encourage continued production.

---

## Potatoes

Planting potatoes on Valentine's Day is a time-honored Texas tradition. It's actually a pretty solid date — close enough to the recommended planting window for most of the state and easy to remember.

### Varieties for Texas

- Kennebec (white, excellent all-purpose)
- Yukon Gold (yellow, buttery — the gold standard for mashed potatoes)
- Red Pontiac (red skin, waxy, great for roasting)
- Pontiac (classic red)
- Fingerlings (fun, gourmet, great for roasting)

### Planting

Plant certified seed potatoes (not grocery store potatoes, which may carry disease). Cut into pieces with 2–3 eyes each, let cut sides dry for a day. Plant 4 inches deep, 12 inches apart, in loose soil. As plants grow, "hill" soil or mulch around the stems — potatoes form above the seed piece, so you want to keep adding material.

### Planting Dates

January 15–February 28 for most of Texas. South TX can start in January; North TX should wait until mid-February.

### Harvest

Harvest "new potatoes" once plants flower (about 70 days). For full-size potatoes, wait until the tops die back (90–120 days). Dig carefully with a fork. Cure in a cool, dark place for 1–2 weeks before storing.

---

## Radishes

The instant gratification crop. Radishes germinate in 3–5 days and are harvestable in 25–30 days. If you need a gardening win right now, plant radishes.

### Varieties for Texas

- Cherry Belle (classic round red, fast)
- French Breakfast (oblong, mild, pretty)
- Watermelon Radish (green outside, stunning pink inside — slow to mature but worth it)
- Daikon (large Asian radish, plant in fall for best results)

### Planting Dates

Direct sow September–March. Succession plant every 2 weeks for continuous harvest.

### Tips

Don't over-fertilize (too much nitrogen = all leaves, no root). Thin to 2 inches apart. Pull promptly when mature — overgrown radishes turn woody, hollow, and hot. Radishes are excellent companion plants and row markers.

---

## Spinach

True spinach is a cool-season diva in Texas — it bolts at the first hint of warmth. But during the short window when it's happy, fresh spinach is spectacular.

### Varieties for Texas

- Bloomsdale Long Standing (savoy type, best bolt resistance)
- Space (smooth-leaf, easy to clean, slow to bolt)
- Tyee (semi-savoy, widely adapted)

For heat-tolerant alternatives, try Malabar spinach (warm-season vine — not true spinach but a good substitute) or New Zealand spinach.

### Planting Dates

Direct sow September–October for fall, January–February for spring. Spinach needs cool temperatures for germination — above 85°F soil temp and it won't sprout.

### Tips

Rich soil, consistent moisture, partial shade in spring to delay bolting. Harvest outer leaves for cut-and-come-again production. Once the plant sends up a flower stalk, it's done — pull it and plant something else.

---

## Turnips & Rutabaga

Turnips are the workhorses of the Southern garden. Easy to grow, fast to mature, and like beets, you get a two-for-one: roots and greens. Rutabagas are their slower, sweeter cousin.

### Varieties for Texas

- Purple Top White Globe (the classic turnip, hard to beat)
- Tokyo Cross (white, fast, tender — harvest young)
- Seven Top (grown for greens only — the roots are basically an afterthought)
- American Purple Top (rutabaga, sweet, needs longer season)

### Planting Dates

Direct sow August–October for fall, February for spring. Turnips mature in 45–60 days; rutabagas need 90 days, so plant them early.

### Harvest

Pull turnips when 2–3 inches across. Harvest greens anytime they're large enough to eat. Both turnips and rutabagas sweeten after frost.

# Part IV: Mastering the Details

# Chapter 19: Pest & Disease Management

Every Texas gardener, at some point, will walk out to their garden and discover something terrible has happened overnight. Your beautiful squash plant is wilted. Your tomato leaves have mysterious spots. Something has eaten your bean seedlings down to nubs. Welcome to the club.

The good news: most Texas garden pests and diseases are manageable if you catch them early and respond appropriately. The goal isn't a pest-free garden — that doesn't exist. The goal is keeping damage below the threshold where it affects your harvest.

## The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach

Before you reach for any spray — organic or otherwise — follow these steps:

1. **Identify the problem.** Is it actually a pest? Is it actually a disease? Or is it environmental stress (heat, drought, nutrient deficiency)? Misdiagnosis leads to wasted time and money.
2. **Assess the damage.** A few aphids aren't an emergency. A few hundred aphids are. Learn what "threshold" means for each pest.
3. **Start with cultural controls.** Healthy soil, proper spacing, good air circulation, resistant varieties, and crop rotation prevent most problems.
4. **Use mechanical controls.** Hand-picking, row covers, traps, water sprays.
5. **Biological controls.** Encourage beneficial insects. Release ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps.
6. **Chemical controls (organic first).** Neem oil, Bt, insecticidal soap, spinosad, copper fungicide.
7. **Conventional chemicals as a last resort.** If you go this route, read labels carefully and follow directions exactly.

## The Top 15 Texas Garden Pests

### 1. Squash Vine Borers
**The damage:** Your squash plant suddenly wilts on a hot afternoon and doesn't recover. At the base of the stem, you'll find sawdust-like frass and a hole where the borer entered.
**The fix:** Wrap stems with aluminum foil at planting. Inject Bt into stems at first sign of frass. Succession plant squash — if borers kill your first planting, the second one may escape. Butternut squash is more resistant than other types.

### 2. Tomato Hornworms
**The damage:** Large chunks of tomato leaves and fruit disappearing overnight. Look for large (3–4 inch) green caterpillars with white diagonal stripes.
**The fix:** Hand-pick. They're big enough to see (and horrifying enough to remember). If you see white cocoons on a hornworm, leave it — braconid wasps are parasitizing it. Bt spray works on young hornworms.

### 3. Aphids
**The damage:** Clusters of tiny soft-bodied insects on new growth, undersides of leaves. Sticky honeydew residue. Distorted, curling leaves.
**The fix:** Strong blast of water from the hose knocks them off. Ladybugs and lacewings devour them. Insecticidal soap for heavy infestations. Neem oil as a longer-term solution.

### 4. Whiteflies
**The damage:** Clouds of tiny white insects fly up when you disturb plants. Yellow, sticky leaves. Common in fall, especially on tomatoes and peppers.
**The fix:** Yellow sticky traps. Insecticidal soap. Neem oil. Reflective mulch (silver or aluminum) confuses them. Remove heavily infested plants.

### 5. Stink Bugs & Leaf-Footed Bugs
**The damage:** Piercing-sucking damage to fruit — cloudy spots on tomatoes, deformed peppers, damaged beans. The bugs themselves are shield-shaped (stink bugs) or have flat leaf-like projections on their hind legs (leaf-footed bugs).
**The fix:** Hand-pick into a bucket of soapy water (wear gloves — stink bugs earn their name). Neem oil. Row covers early in the season. Keep the garden clean of debris where they overwinter.

### 6. Fire Ants
**The damage:** Painful stings for you. Mound-building in garden beds. They can damage seedlings and ripening fruit near the ground.
**The fix:** Spinosad-based baits (organic). Mound drenches with approved products. Diatomaceous earth around beds. Fire ants are a permanent feature of Texas life — manage them, don't expect to eradicate them.

### 7. Flea Beetles
**The damage:** Tiny round holes in leaves, like someone attacked your plants with a hole punch. Worst on eggplant, brassicas, and young seedlings.
**The fix:** Row covers on young plants. Neem oil. Spinosad. Plants usually outgrow the damage if they're otherwise healthy.

### 8. Spider Mites
**The damage:** Stippled, bronzed leaves. Fine webbing on undersides of leaves. Worst in hot, dry weather (so... most of Texas summer).
**The fix:** Strong water spray. Keep plants well-watered (stressed plants are more susceptible). Neem oil. Insecticidal soap. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides — they kill the predatory mites that naturally control spider mites.

### 9. Grasshoppers
**The damage:** These voracious chewers can strip a garden fast in a bad grasshopper year. They eat leaves, stems, fruit — basically everything.
**The fix:** Nosema locustae (biological bait). Row covers. Chickens (seriously — chickens love grasshoppers). Kaolin clay spray. In truly bad years, just plant extra and share with the hoppers. That's Texas.

### 10. Cabbage Loopers & Imported Cabbage Worms
**The damage:** Holes in brassica leaves (broccoli, cabbage, kale, cauliflower). Green caterpillars on leaf surfaces.
**The fix:** Bt spray — incredibly effective and targets only caterpillars. Row covers prevent the adult moths/butterflies from laying eggs. Hand-pick if numbers are small.

### 11. Deer
**The damage:** Browsed plants, usually overnight. Clean, ragged bite marks (deer tear rather than cut cleanly).
**The fix:** Fencing (8 feet high — deer are Olympic jumpers). Deer repellent sprays (reapply after rain). Soap bars hung around the garden (mixed results). Dog (excellent results). Ultimately, a tall fence is the only reliable solution.

### 12. Rabbits
**The damage:** Clean-cut damage at ground level. Young seedlings mowed down.
**The fix:** Chicken wire fencing, 2 feet high, buried 6 inches into the ground. Blood meal around plants. Motion-activated sprinklers.

### 13. Armadillos
**The damage:** Divots and holes dug throughout the garden as they root for grubs and insects. They don't eat your plants — they destroy them as collateral damage while digging.
**The fix:** Grub control reduces the food source. Fencing (buried 12 inches deep — they dig). Live traps. Motion-activated sprinklers. Mostly, you learn to live with occasional armadillo visits and repair the damage with a sigh.

### 14. Grubs (June Beetle Larvae)
**The damage:** White C-shaped larvae in the soil that feed on roots. Wilting plants with damaged root systems.
**The fix:** Beneficial nematodes (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora). Milky spore disease. Turn soil to expose grubs to birds. Healthy soil with lots of organic matter supports predators.

### 15. Cutworms
**The damage:** Seedlings cut off at ground level overnight. The caterpillars hide in the soil during the day.
**The fix:** Cardboard or newspaper collars around transplant stems (pushed 1 inch into soil). Bt applied to soil surface. Hand-pick at night with a flashlight.

## Common Diseases

### Early Blight (Tomatoes)
Brown spots with concentric rings on lower leaves, working upward. Caused by *Alternaria* fungus.
**Prevention:** Mulch to prevent soil splash. Remove lower leaves. Proper spacing for air circulation. Copper fungicide if severe.

### Powdery Mildew (Squash, Cucumbers)
White powdery coating on leaves. Common in humid conditions with poor air circulation.
**Prevention:** Resistant varieties. Good spacing. Neem oil. Potassium bicarbonate spray. Remove severely affected leaves.

### Bacterial Wilt (Cucumbers, Melons)
Sudden wilting that doesn't recover with watering. Spread by cucumber beetles.
**Prevention:** Control cucumber beetles with row covers early. No cure once plants are infected — remove and destroy them.

### Root-Knot Nematodes
Gnarled, knotty roots. Stunted plants that wilt easily despite adequate water. Common in sandy soils.
**Prevention:** Crop rotation. Plant marigolds as a cover crop (they suppress nematode populations). Solarize soil. Resistant varieties when available.

### Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt (Tomatoes, Peppers)
Progressive wilting, often starting on one side of the plant. Yellowing and browning of lower leaves.
**Prevention:** Resistant varieties (look for "VFN" on tomato labels). Crop rotation. Solarization. No cure once present — remove infected plants.

# Chapter 20: Companion Planting & Crop Rotation

## Companion Planting: Friends and Enemies in the Garden

Companion planting is part science, part tradition, and part "my grandmother swore by it, so who am I to argue." The basic idea: some plants help each other when grown close together, and some plants hinder each other. Here are the best-documented combinations for Texas gardens.

### The Three Sisters
The classic companion planting trio: corn, beans, and squash. Corn provides a trellis for beans. Beans fix nitrogen in the soil that feeds the corn. Squash sprawls at ground level, shading the soil and suppressing weeds. This combination was developed by Indigenous peoples and it works as well today as it did centuries ago.

**In Texas:** Plant corn first. When it's 6 inches tall, plant beans and squash around the corn hills. Use pole beans, not bush beans. Works best with field corn rather than sweet corn (sturdier stalks).

### Proven Companions

| Crop | Good Companions | Bad Companions |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Tomatoes | Basil, carrots, marigolds, parsley | Fennel, brassicas, corn |
| Peppers | Basil, carrots, onions, spinach | Fennel, beans (some sources) |
| Beans | Corn, squash, carrots, beets, cucumbers | Onions, garlic, peppers |
| Squash | Beans, corn, radishes, marigolds | Potatoes |
| Cucumbers | Beans, peas, radishes, sunflowers | Potatoes, aromatic herbs (sage) |
| Carrots | Tomatoes, peas, lettuce, onions | Dill (mature plants) |
| Lettuce | Carrots, radishes, strawberries, chives | None significant |
| Brassicas | Onions, garlic, beets, celery, dill | Strawberries, tomatoes, beans |

### Marigolds: The Universal Companion

French marigolds (*Tagetes patula*) deserve a special mention. They suppress root-knot nematodes in the soil, repel whiteflies and other pests, and attract beneficial insects. Plant them everywhere. Border your beds with them. Tuck them between tomato plants. They're cheap, easy, and the closest thing to a magic bullet that organic gardening has.

### Herbs as Pest Deterrents

- **Basil** planted near tomatoes repels aphids and may improve tomato flavor (debated, but it smells great).
- **Dill** attracts beneficial insects, especially parasitic wasps and hoverflies.
- **Cilantro** in flower attracts lacewings and ladybugs.
- **Rosemary** and **sage** repel cabbage moths.
- **Mint** deters flea beetles and ants — but plant it in containers or it will take over your entire garden, your neighbor's yard, and possibly the state.

## Crop Rotation: Why It Matters

Crop rotation — moving plant families to different beds each year — is one of the most effective disease and pest prevention strategies you have. Soilborne pathogens and pests build up when the same crops grow in the same soil year after year.

### The Simple 4-Bed Rotation

Divide your crops into four families and rotate them through four beds over four years:

**Bed 1 → Bed 2 → Bed 3 → Bed 4 → Back to Bed 1**

1. **Nightshades** (Solanaceae): Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes
2. **Legumes** (Fabaceae): Beans, peas, cowpeas — these fix nitrogen, enriching the soil for the next group
3. **Brassicas** (Brassicaceae): Broccoli, cabbage, kale, cauliflower, turnips, radishes — heavy feeders that benefit from the nitrogen legumes left behind
4. **Cucurbits & Alliums** (mixed): Squash, cucumbers, melons, onions, garlic

### Rotation Rules

- Never plant nightshades in the same bed two years in a row. Fusarium and verticillium wilt persist in soil.
- Follow legumes with heavy feeders to take advantage of nitrogen fixation.
- Alliums (onions, garlic) help "clean" beds of soilborne diseases.
- If you have nematode problems, grow marigolds as a cover crop in affected beds.

### When Rotation Is Hard

Small gardens make strict rotation difficult. Do the best you can. Even alternating between two plant families is better than planting tomatoes in the same spot every single year. Container gardening helps — you can simply replace the soil mix.

# Chapter 21: Season Extension Techniques

One of the best-kept secrets in Texas gardening? You can grow food nearly 365 days a year with a few simple season-extension tools. The brutal summer heat is actually a bigger obstacle than winter cold in most of the state, so we'll cover both ends of the thermometer.

## Extending Into Winter

### Row Covers & Frost Blankets

The single most useful season-extension tool in Texas. Lightweight spun-bonded fabric drapes over plants to provide 4–8°F of frost protection — enough to keep greens, root vegetables, and cool-season crops growing through all but the hardest freezes.

**How to use them:**
- Drape directly over plants or support on hoops for better air circulation.
- Secure edges with soil, rocks, or landscape staples.
- Remove during warm days to prevent overheating and allow pollination.
- Heavyweight covers (1.5 oz/sq yard) provide more protection than lightweight (0.5 oz).

### Cold Frames

A cold frame is essentially a bottomless box with a clear lid — a mini greenhouse. Build one from scrap lumber and an old window, or buy a kit. Place it over a garden bed and grow lettuce, spinach, and greens straight through winter.

**DIY cold frame basics:**
- Back wall: 18 inches tall (faces north)
- Front wall: 12 inches tall (faces south)
- Lid: angled glass or polycarbonate panel
- Prop open on warm days (above 50°F) to vent excess heat
- Location: south-facing, against a wall or fence for thermal mass

In Central and South Texas, a cold frame is overkill most winters — row covers alone will get you through. In North Texas, a cold frame extends the salad greens season by 2–3 months.

### Low Tunnels (Hoop Houses)

Think of these as long, narrow greenhouses made from PVC hoops and greenhouse plastic. They're inexpensive, easy to build, and incredibly effective. A low tunnel over a garden bed creates a microclimate 10–20°F warmer than the outside air.

**Materials:** 1/2-inch PVC pipe, rebar stakes (pound into soil, slip PVC over them), 6-mil greenhouse plastic, and clips or clamps to secure the plastic. Total cost: $30–50 for a 4x8-foot bed.

## Extending Through Summer

### Shade Cloth

In Texas, extending the *spring* season into summer is just as important as extending fall into winter. Shade cloth — woven fabric that blocks a percentage of sunlight — keeps temperatures under the canopy 10–15°F cooler.

**Recommendations:**
- 30–40% shade for tomatoes, peppers, and heat-tolerant crops
- 50–60% shade for lettuce, spinach, and cool-season crops you're trying to extend
- Install on a simple PVC frame above the bed
- Keep sides open for air circulation

Shade cloth can keep spring tomatoes producing 2–4 weeks longer and get fall lettuce started 2–3 weeks earlier. The ROI on a $20 piece of shade cloth is outstanding.

### Mulch as Season Extension

Heavy mulch (4–6 inches) insulates soil, keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter. In summer, mulched beds can be 10–15°F cooler at the root zone than unmulched beds. In winter, mulch protects root crops from freezing. It's free or cheap, and it works. This is the most underappreciated season-extension tool.

## Region-Specific Strategies

**North Texas (Zone 7b–8a):** All of the above. You'll benefit most from cold frames and low tunnels. A heated greenhouse is worthwhile if you're serious about year-round production.

**Central Texas (Zone 8a–8b):** Row covers handle most winters. Focus more on shade cloth and summer survival. Low tunnels for extra-cold snaps.

**Gulf Coast (Zone 9a):** Winter protection is rarely needed except during unusual arctic events (we all remember February 2021). Focus on shade cloth and summer heat management. Humidity is your bigger challenge — increase spacing and air flow.

**South Texas (Zone 9b–10a):** You barely need winter protection. Your season extension challenge is entirely about surviving summer. Shade cloth, heavy mulch, and drought-tolerant varieties are your tools.

**West Texas (Zone 7b–8a):** Similar cold-protection needs to North Texas, but add wind protection. Row covers need to be anchored *extremely* well. Consider windbreaks (temporary fencing, tall crops, or permanent shrubs on the windward side).

## Glossary

**Bolting:** When a plant prematurely sends up a flower stalk, usually due to heat or long days. Signals the end of leaf/root harvest quality.

**Brassica:** Plants in the cabbage family including broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collards, and turnips.

**Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis):** A naturally occurring soil bacterium used as an organic insecticide. Targets caterpillars specifically. Safe for humans, pets, and beneficial insects.

**Compost:** Decomposed organic matter used as a soil amendment. The single best thing you can add to any Texas soil.

**Cover Crop:** A crop grown primarily to protect and enrich the soil rather than for harvest. Examples: crimson clover, buckwheat, cowpeas, winter rye.

**Crop Rotation:** Moving plant families to different garden areas each year to prevent disease and pest buildup.

**Determinate:** A tomato variety that grows to a set size and ripens fruit over a concentrated period. Good for canning.

**Direct Sow:** Planting seeds directly into the garden soil rather than starting indoors and transplanting.

**Drip Irrigation:** A watering system that delivers water slowly and directly to the root zone through emitters. The most water-efficient method.

**Frost Date:** The average date of the last spring frost or first fall frost for your area. A guideline, not a guarantee.

**Hardening Off:** Gradually acclimating indoor-grown seedlings to outdoor conditions over 7–10 days before transplanting.

**Heirloom:** An open-pollinated variety that has been passed down through generations (generally 50+ years old). Often prized for flavor.

**Hybrid:** A variety created by crossing two different parent plants. Often more vigorous and disease-resistant, but seeds won't come true in the next generation.

**Indeterminate:** A tomato variety that continues growing and producing fruit until killed by frost or disease. Needs sturdy support.

**IPM (Integrated Pest Management):** A systematic approach to pest control that uses multiple strategies, with chemical controls as a last resort.

**Mulch:** Material spread on the soil surface to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate temperature. Organic mulches (straw, leaves, wood chips) also improve soil as they decompose.

**Neem Oil:** An organic pesticide/fungicide derived from the neem tree. Effective against many soft-bodied insects and some fungal diseases.

**Root-Knot Nematode:** Microscopic soil-dwelling worms that cause gnarled, knotty roots. A significant pest in sandy Texas soils.

**Row Cover:** Lightweight fabric draped over plants for frost protection, pest exclusion, or shade. Available in various weights for different purposes.

**Side-Dress:** Applying fertilizer alongside growing plants during the season, rather than only at planting time.

**Solarization:** Covering soil with clear plastic during summer to use solar heat to kill weeds, pests, and pathogens. Very effective in Texas summers.

**Succession Planting:** Planting the same crop at 2–3 week intervals for a continuous harvest rather than one big crop all at once.

**Transplant:** A seedling started indoors (or purchased) and planted into the garden. Also the act of moving a seedling from pot to garden.

This book exists because of the generous Texas gardening community — the Master Gardeners who answer the same questions every spring with patience and grace, the extension agents who do vital work for peanuts, the online communities where beginners are welcomed and not mocked, and the countless backyard gardeners who've shared their hard-won wisdom over fences and at farmers' markets.

Special thanks to the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, whose research and publications form the backbone of reliable Texas gardening information.

And to every first-time gardener who's reading this: welcome. You're about to discover that growing your own food in Texas soil is one of the most satisfying, humbling, frustrating, and joyful things you can do.
