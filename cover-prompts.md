# Harvest Home Guides — Book Cover Prompts for Grok Image Generation

## Series Design Template

**Consistent elements across all 10 covers:**
- **Layout:** Top 25% — series banner "HARVEST HOME GUIDES" in a warm terracotta/rust ribbon or banner. Middle 50% — hero illustration. Bottom 25% — title "[Region] Vegetable Gardening" in large, bold serif font. Author "Evan Maxon" below in smaller complementary font.
- **Style:** Warm, sunlit watercolor-meets-photography hybrid. Lush, abundant, slightly idealized. NOT clip art. Think Gibbs Smith or Timber Press cover quality.
- **Shared palette base:** Warm cream/linen background (#F5F0E1), terracotta banner (#C1582A), deep forest green text accents (#2D5A3D), warm gold highlights (#D4A843).
- **Dimensions:** 1600×2560px (Kindle). Paperback adds spine (varies by page count ~0.5") and back cover.
- **Text-free zone:** Prompts generate the ILLUSTRATION ONLY. Text will be overlaid in design software. Leave clear space at top 20% and bottom 30% for text overlay (lighter/simpler background in those zones).

## Implementation Notes

1. **Generate illustration only** — all text (title, author, series name) should be added in Canva, InDesign, or similar. The Grok-generated image is the background/hero art.
2. **Request variations** — generate 3-4 variations per cover and pick the best composition.
3. **Upscale** — Grok outputs may need upscaling to 1600×2560. Use an AI upscaler to hit KDP specs.
4. **Paperback covers** — extend the illustration horizontally for full wrap (front + spine + back). Generate a wider version or use content-aware fill for the back cover.
5. **Thumbnail test** — shrink each cover to 150×240px and confirm the composition reads clearly. The vegetable imagery should be recognizable even tiny.
6. **Consistency pass** — after generating all 10, adjust brightness/saturation/warmth so they look like a matched set on a bookshelf or Amazon series page.
