## Grok Image Prompts

**Style notes:** Prompts generate the ILLUSTRATION ONLY. Text is overlaid in Figma. Regional accent colors noted below are for the ILLUSTRATIONS only — they describe the natural color palette of each region's scene. The text area stays consistent across all books.

**Grok Prompt:**
> A warm, sunlit vegetable garden scene in the Texas Hill Country.

Golden hour light from the left. Style: rich, warm, photorealistic with a painterly softness. Aspect ratio 5:8 vertical. The top 20% and bottom 30% should be relatively uncluttered (sky at top, soft ground at bottom) to allow text overlay.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Generate illustration only** — all text (title, author, series name) should be added in Canva, InDesign, or similar. The Grok-generated image is the background/hero art.
2. **Request variations** — generate 3-4 variations per cover and pick the best composition.
3. **Upscale** — Grok outputs may need upscaling to 1600×2560. Use an AI upscaler to hit KDP specs.
4. **Paperback covers** — extend the illustration horizontally for full wrap (front + spine + back). Generate a wider version or use content-aware fill for the back cover.
5. **Thumbnail test** — shrink each cover to 150×240px and confirm the composition reads clearly. The vegetable imagery should be recognizable even tiny.
6. **Consistency pass** — after generating all 10, adjust brightness/saturation/warmth so they look like a matched set on a bookshelf or Amazon series page.
