# Harvest Home Guides: Midwest Vegetable Gardening

## A Month-by-Month Planting Guide for the Heartland

---

# Introduction: Welcome to the Heartland

You live in the middle of the most productive farmland on Earth, and yet growing a tomato in your backyard feels like an act of defiance against nature.

That's the Midwest gardening paradox. The soil beneath your feet grows enough corn and soybeans to feed continents, but your vegetable garden has to survive late May frosts, July heat that wilts everything standing, August humidity that breeds disease faster than you can spray, and the ever-present threat of winter arriving six weeks before you're ready.

You bought this book because you want to grow vegetables in the Midwest and you want someone to tell you exactly how to do it. Not generic advice written by someone in California who thinks "cold" means 45°F. Real advice for real Midwest weather — the kind where you're wearing shorts and a winter coat in the same week, sometimes the same day.

This book covers twelve states: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. That's a massive stretch of geography, from Zone 3 in northern Minnesota (where the ground freezes four feet deep) to Zone 6b in southern Missouri (where you might occasionally forget you live in the Midwest at all). We'll address those differences throughout.

Here's what you'll get:

- **Part I: Getting Started** — Climate zones, soil types, water management, and garden planning specific to the Midwest
- **Part II: Month-by-Month Guide** — What to do every single month, January through December
- **Part III: Vegetable Profiles** — Detailed growing guides for 30+ vegetables, organized by warm-season and cool-season
- **Part IV: Mastering the Details** — Pests, diseases, companion planting, season extension, and complete planting calendars

Every chapter ends with common mistakes so you can learn from other people's failures instead of your own. There are Pro Tips throughout from experienced Midwest gardeners who've been doing this for decades.

Let's grow something.

# PART I: GETTING STARTED

---

# Chapter 1: The Midwest Climate — Understanding What You're Working With

The Midwest is a study in extremes. You'll experience temperature swings of 130°F or more across a single year — from -30°F in January to 100°F in July. No other major gardening region in the country asks plants to tolerate that kind of range.

## USDA Hardiness Zones

The Midwest spans Zones 3a through 6b. Here's what that means in practical terms:

| Zone | Avg. Winter Low | Where You'll Find It |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| 3a | -40°F to -35°F | Northern Minnesota, northern North Dakota |
| 3b | -35°F to -30°F | Northern Wisconsin, central Minnesota, central North Dakota |
| 4a | -30°F to -25°F | Southern Minnesota, northern Iowa, northern Wisconsin, northern Michigan, South Dakota |
| 4b | -25°F to -20°F | Central Iowa, central Wisconsin, central Michigan, southern South Dakota |
| 5a | -20°F to -15°F | Southern Iowa, northern Illinois, northern Indiana, northern Ohio, southern Michigan, eastern Nebraska |
| 5b | -15°F to -10°F | Central Illinois, central Indiana, central Ohio, central Kansas, central Nebraska |
| 6a | -10°F to -5°F | Southern Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, southern Kansas |
| 6b | -5°F to 0°F | Southern Missouri, southeastern Kansas |

Your zone tells you about winter survival for perennial plants — and it sets the bookends of your growing season. But zone alone doesn't tell the whole story. A Zone 5a garden in northern Illinois behaves very differently from a Zone 5a garden in eastern Nebraska, because humidity, rainfall, and wind patterns vary enormously.

## Growing Season Length

This is the number that really matters for vegetable gardening. Your growing season is the number of frost-free days between your average last spring frost and your average first fall frost.

| Region | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Growing Season |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Northern Minnesota/North Dakota (Zone 3) | May 15–June 1 | Sept 10–25 | 100–130 days |
| Northern Iowa/Wisconsin/Michigan (Zone 4) | May 1–15 | Sept 20–Oct 5 | 130–155 days |
| Central Midwest (Zone 5) | April 15–May 1 | Oct 1–15 | 155–175 days |
| Southern Midwest (Zone 6) | April 1–15 | Oct 15–Nov 1 | 175–200 days |

Those are averages. The Midwest is famous for late frosts that break every rule. A May 20 frost in Zone 5 when you thought you were safe? Happens about once every four or five years. We plan for it.

## Continental Climate: What Makes the Midwest Different

The Midwest has a **continental climate**, meaning there's no ocean nearby to moderate temperatures. This gives you:

- **Rapid temperature changes.** A 40°F temperature drop in 24 hours is unremarkable. A 60°F swing across a week is not uncommon in spring and fall.
- **Intense summer heat.** July and August regularly hit 90-100°F with dew points in the 70s. That combination of heat and humidity creates a sauna that stress plants and breeds fungal disease.
- **Brutal winters.** Polar vortex events can send temperatures to -20°F or below across most of the region. This matters for overwintering crops and perennial herbs.
- **Variable precipitation.** The eastern Midwest (Ohio, Indiana, Michigan) gets 35-45 inches of rain annually. The western Midwest (Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas) gets 15-25 inches. That's a massive difference in water planning.
- **Wind.** Especially across the Great Plains states — Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas — persistent wind accelerates evaporation, causes physical damage to plants, and makes row covers fly off at the worst possible moment.

## Regional Microclimates

Within the Midwest, several factors create significant local variation:

**The Great Lakes Effect.** If you garden near Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, or Lake Superior, you experience moderated temperatures (cooler springs, warmer falls), more cloud cover, and lake-effect precipitation. Michigan's western fruit belt exists because of this effect. The downside: your spring is colder and later than your zone suggests.

**River Valleys.** The Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio river valleys tend to be warmer, more humid, and more prone to fog and late-season warmth. River bottom land is incredibly fertile but floods.

**Urban Heat Islands.** Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Columbus, Indianapolis — cities are 3-5°F warmer than surrounding rural areas. If you garden in a city, you effectively gain half a zone.

**Elevation.** Most of the Midwest is fairly flat, but the Ozarks in Missouri, the bluffs along the Mississippi, and the hills of southern Ohio and Indiana create pockets that behave differently from the surrounding area. Cold air settles in valleys — avoid planting frost-sensitive crops in low spots.

## The Midwest Gardening Year in One Paragraph

Your gardening year starts indoors in February or March, moves to cold-hardy transplants and direct-sown cool-season crops in April, explodes into full production from June through September, winds down with fall crops in October, and shuts down hard in November. December and January are for planning, seed ordering, and pretending you don't miss it. The key skill in Midwest gardening is timing — getting crops in early enough to mature before the season ends, but late enough to avoid getting killed by frost. This book will give you those dates for every crop and every zone.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trusting the calendar over the thermometer.** "May 1" doesn't mean anything if there's a frost advisory. Watch the weather, not the date.
- **Ignoring zone subregions.** A garden on a south-facing slope in Zone 4b might perform like Zone 5a. A garden in a north-facing valley in Zone 5a might perform like Zone 4b. Observe your specific site.
- **Underestimating wind.** Especially in Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. Wind desiccates plants, topples supports, and strips away moisture. Plan windbreaks.
- **Assuming your growing season is shorter than it is.** With season extension tools (covered in Chapter 21), you can effectively garden 10-11 months of the year even in Zone 4.

# Chapter 2: Midwest Soil — The Best Dirt on Earth (Mostly)

You have an unfair advantage over gardeners in most of the country: your soil is, by global standards, phenomenal. The Midwest sits on some of the deepest, richest topsoil anywhere, built over thousands of years by prairie grasses and glacial deposits. Farmers around the world would trade their left arm for what you're standing on.

That said, "good soil" doesn't mean "perfect soil." And it definitely doesn't mean "you can skip soil preparation."

## Soil Types by Region

**Prairie Soils (Mollisols).** The dominant soil type across Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and eastern portions of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas. These are dark, deep, rich in organic matter (3-6%), and naturally fertile. If you garden on this soil, congratulations — you won the gardening lottery. Typical pH: 6.0-7.0.

**Glacial Till Soils.** Found across Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota and Indiana. Glaciers deposited a mix of clay, sand, gravel, and rocks. Quality varies enormously — sometimes within the same yard. You might dig into beautiful loam in one spot and hit compacted clay or solid gravel three feet away. Typical pH: 6.0-7.5.

**River Alluvial Soils.** Along the Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, and their tributaries. Incredibly fertile, deep, and well-structured — but they flood. If your property is in a river bottom, you have amazing soil and a problematic relationship with water. Typical pH: 6.5-7.5.

**Western Plains Soils.** In western Kansas, western Nebraska, and the western Dakotas, soils are thinner, drier, higher in pH (7.0-8.5), and may contain caliche — a layer of calcium carbonate that's basically natural concrete. These soils need organic matter, irrigation, and sometimes sulfur to lower pH.

**Ozark Soils.** Southern Missouri sits on thin, rocky, acidic soil (pH 4.5-6.0) over limestone and chert. It's the toughest gardening soil in the Midwest. You'll need to build soil aggressively with compost and raised beds.

## Testing Your Soil

Before you do anything else, get a soil test. Not a $12 kit from the hardware store — a real test from your state's cooperative extension service.

Every Midwest state has one:

| State | Extension Lab | Approximate Cost |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Ohio | Ohio State University | $15-25 |
| Indiana | Purdue University | $10-20 |
| Illinois | University of Illinois | $15-25 |
| Michigan | Michigan State University | $25 |
| Wisconsin | University of Wisconsin | $15-20 |
| Minnesota | University of Minnesota | $15-25 |
| Iowa | Iowa State University | $15-25 |
| Missouri | University of Missouri | $15-25 |
| Kansas | Kansas State University | $10-20 |
| Nebraska | University of Nebraska | $10-25 |
| North Dakota | North Dakota State University | $15 |
| South Dakota | South Dakota State University | $10-20 |

A proper soil test tells you:

- **pH** — Most vegetables want 6.0-7.0. If your soil is too acidic, add lime. Too alkaline, add sulfur or eleite sulfur.
- **Macronutrients** — Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K). Your test results will tell you exactly what to add and how much.
- **Organic matter percentage** — You want 3-5% minimum. Below that, you need to add compost.
- **Soil texture** — Sand, silt, and clay percentages. This determines drainage and water-holding capacity.
- **Micronutrients** — Iron, zinc, manganese, boron, etc. Deficiencies are less common in Midwest soils but do occur, especially in high-pH western soils.

> **Pro Tip:** Test every 2-3 years. Your soil changes as you garden. Take samples from 6-8 inches deep, and sample different garden areas separately — the bed by the house foundation will have different pH than the bed in the middle of the yard.

## Improving Midwest Soil

Even with great native soil, improvement is a constant process.

**Compost.** The single best amendment for any Midwest soil. Apply 2-4 inches annually, worked into the top 6-8 inches. Compost improves clay drainage, sandy water retention, and biological activity in all soil types. Make your own from fall leaves (you have no shortage of those), grass clippings, kitchen scraps, and garden waste.

**Cover Crops.** Plant winter rye, crimson clover, or field peas in fall after your garden is cleared. They prevent erosion, add organic matter, and (in the case of legumes) fix nitrogen. Till or mow them in spring, 2-3 weeks before planting. This is standard practice for Midwest farmers, and it works just as well in gardens.

**Mulch.** Straw, shredded leaves, or wood chips on the surface suppress weeds, retain moisture, moderate soil temperature, and slowly decompose into organic matter. Apply 2-4 inches around established plants. Keep mulch 2 inches away from plant stems to prevent rot.

**Clay Soil Fix.** If you have heavy clay (common in parts of Ohio, Indiana, and glacial areas), don't add sand — it creates something resembling concrete. Instead, add compost. Lots of it. 3-4 inches per year, worked in. Gypsum (calcium sulfate) can help break up clay without changing pH. Apply 40-50 lbs per 1,000 sq ft.

**High-pH Fix.** For alkaline soils in western Kansas, western Nebraska, and the western Dakotas, add elemental sulfur (1-2 lbs per 100 sq ft to drop pH by 0.5-1.0 point) and work in acidic organic matter like pine needles or peat moss. This is a slow process — sulfur takes 6-12 months to fully react.

## Raised Beds: When to Use Them

Raised beds make sense in the Midwest when:

- Your native soil is extremely heavy clay or thin rocky soil (Ozarks)
- Your yard has drainage problems (common in flat areas)
- You want to warm the soil faster in spring (raised beds warm 1-2 weeks earlier)
- Your property has soil contamination concerns (older urban lots)

Build beds 8-12 inches deep, 3-4 feet wide (so you can reach the center from either side). Fill with a 60/30/10 mix of topsoil, compost, and perlite or coarse sand. Cedar or composite lumber lasts longest in Midwest weather — avoid treated lumber for food gardens.

> **Pro Tip:** In Zones 3-4, consider building beds 12-18 inches deep and insulating them with straw bales on the outside during early spring. This creates a mini heat sink that protects roots from late frost far better than ground-level gardens.

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the soil test.** You're guessing without it. Guessing leads to over-fertilizing or under-fertilizing, both of which cost you yield.
- **Adding lime or sulfur without testing.** These are corrections for specific problems. Adding lime to already-neutral soil pushes pH too high and locks out nutrients.
- **Tilling wet clay.** If you can squeeze a handful of soil and it forms a tight, shiny ball, it's too wet to work. Tilling wet clay creates brick-like clods that take years to fix.
- **Ignoring drainage.** Midwest thunderstorms can drop 2-4 inches of rain in an hour. If your garden doesn't drain, roots drown. Grade your beds to shed water, or install French drains in problem areas.

# Chapter 3: Water in the Midwest — Too Much, Too Little, Rarely Just Right

Water management in the Midwest is a balancing act. In June, you might be running the sprinkler. In July, a storm drops four inches overnight and everything is waterlogged. By August, you haven't seen rain in three weeks and the garden is gasping.

## How Much Water Do Vegetables Need?

Most vegetables need **1-1.5 inches of water per week** during the growing season. During hot July and August days (90°F+), demand increases to **1.5-2 inches per week**. Sandy soils need water more frequently in smaller doses. Clay soils need less frequent but deeper watering.

## Water Sources

**Municipal Water.** Reliable but costs money and often contains chlorine. Chlorine is harmless to plants at municipal concentrations, but if you're concerned, fill your watering can the night before and let it off-gas.

**Well Water.** Common in rural Midwest. Usually excellent for gardens, but test for iron content — high iron can stain plants and clog drip emitters. Also test pH; well water in limestone regions (southern Indiana, southern Ohio, Missouri) can be alkaline.

**Rain Barrels.** Great idea in the eastern Midwest (plenty of rain to collect). A 1,000-square-foot roof area can collect about 600 gallons from a 1-inch rain event. One or two 55-gallon barrels will supplement nicely; they won't cover all your needs. Check local regulations — most Midwest states allow residential rain collection without restriction, but a few have nuances.

**Irrigation from Ponds/Streams.** Common on rural properties. Test water quality annually — agricultural runoff may introduce herbicide contamination. Even small amounts of broadleaf herbicides (like dicamba or 2,4-D) can devastate tomatoes and other sensitive crops.

## Irrigation Methods

**Drip Irrigation.** The gold standard. Delivers water directly to the root zone, reduces disease by keeping foliage dry, and wastes minimal water to evaporation. A basic drip system for a 200-square-foot garden costs $50-80 and takes an afternoon to install. Use a timer — $25-40 for a reliable battery-operated model — and you can forget about it.

**Soaker Hoses.** Budget drip irrigation. Lay them along rows, cover with mulch. They're less precise than drip emitters but far better than overhead watering. Replace every 2-3 seasons; they degrade in Midwest sun and freeze cycles.

**Overhead Sprinklers.** Convenient but wasteful. You lose 30-50% to evaporation on hot windy days, and wet foliage promotes fungal disease — a serious problem in the humid Midwest summer. If you use sprinklers, run them early morning (before 8 AM) so leaves dry quickly.

**Hand Watering.** Fine for small gardens and containers. Water at the base of plants, not the leaves. A watering wand with a breaker nozzle gives you control and a gentle flow.

> **Pro Tip:** Mulch is your best water-conservation tool. 3-4 inches of straw mulch reduces watering needs by 30-50%. In the western Midwest where water is scarce, mulch is non-negotiable.

## The Midwest Rain Pattern

Understanding your precipitation pattern helps you plan:

- **April-May:** Frequent rain, often heavy. New gardens may waterlog. Don't overwater — nature usually handles it.
- **June:** Transitional. Can go either way. Thunderstorms are common.
- **July-August:** The dry stretch. Even in the wetter eastern Midwest, July and August often bring 2-3 week dry spells between storms. This is when your irrigation system earns its keep.
- **September-October:** Rain returns. Generally moderate and helpful for fall crops.

The western Midwest (Kansas, Nebraska, Dakotas) gets less total rain and needs irrigation throughout the season. Plan for it from the start.

## Dealing with Too Much Water

Midwest thunderstorms don't mess around. When 3 inches falls in an hour:

1. **Ensure drainage.** Beds should be slightly crowned or sloped. Pathways should channel water away from plants.
2. **Don't walk on saturated soil.** You'll compact it. Wait until it's workable.
3. **Check for erosion.** After heavy rain, inspect for soil washing away from plant roots. Add mulch where needed.
4. **Watch for disease.** Splashing water spreads soil-borne pathogens onto lower leaves. Remove the bottom 6-8 inches of foliage from tomatoes and peppers to create a splash barrier.

## Common Mistakes

- **Watering on a schedule instead of by need.** Stick your finger 2 inches into the soil. If it's dry, water. If it's moist, don't. Simple.
- **Shallow, frequent watering.** This encourages shallow roots that can't handle drought. Water deeply (to 6-8 inches) less often.
- **Overhead watering in the evening.** Leaves stay wet all night. Fungal diseases throw a party. Always water in the morning.
- **No mulch.** In the Midwest, unmulched soil bakes, cracks, and loses moisture at an alarming rate. Mulch everything.

# Chapter 4: Planning Your Midwest Garden

A good plan prevents most problems. A great plan prevents problems AND maximizes your 130-180 day growing season. In the Midwest, you can't afford to waste even a week.

## Choosing Your Site

**Sun.** Vegetables need 6-8 hours of direct sunlight minimum. 10+ is better. Leafy greens can tolerate 4-6 hours. Fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers, squash) need the full 8+. In the Midwest, your best sun exposure is a south-facing or southeast-facing plot with no shade from buildings or trees between 9 AM and 5 PM.

**Drainage.** Avoid low spots where water pools after rain. If your whole yard is flat and poorly drained, raised beds are your answer.

**Access to Water.** Within hose reach. Dragging a hose 200 feet gets old by week two.

**Wind Protection.** Especially important in Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. A fence, hedge, or building on the north and west sides blocks prevailing cold winds in spring and drying winds in summer. Even a temporary windbreak of straw bales or snow fence helps.

**Proximity to the House.** Gardens near the kitchen get tended. Gardens at the back of the property get neglected. The most productive garden is the one you'll actually visit every day.

## Sizing Your Garden

Start small if you're new. Seriously. A 4x8-foot raised bed or a 100-square-foot plot is plenty for a beginner. It will produce an astonishing amount of food if managed well, and it won't burn you out by July.

For experienced gardeners, here's a rough sizing guide:

| Goal | Size | What It Feeds |
|------|------|--------------|
| Supplemental fresh eating | 100-200 sq ft | 1-2 people, summer salads and snacking |
| Significant summer production | 200-500 sq ft | 2-4 people, most summer vegetables |
| Near self-sufficiency (summer) | 500-1,000 sq ft | Family of 4, fresh eating all season |
| Preservation and storage | 1,000-2,000 sq ft | Family of 4 with canning, freezing, root cellaring |

## What to Grow

Grow what you eat. This sounds obvious, but every year, gardeners plant five kinds of peppers and no lettuce, then buy salad at the store all summer. Make a list of the vegetables your household actually consumes, then prioritize those.

**Best bang for your space in the Midwest:**

- **Tomatoes** — Nothing from the store compares. Grow 3-6 plants and you'll eat well from July to frost.
- **Green beans** — Prolific, easy, and freeze beautifully.
- **Zucchini/summer squash** — Two plants feed a family. Three plants feed the neighborhood whether they like it or not.
- **Lettuce and greens** — Succession-plant every 2 weeks for continuous harvest spring through fall.
- **Cucumbers** — Heavy producers if kept picked.
- **Peppers** — Grow well in Midwest summers with proper timing.
- **Herbs** — Basil, dill, parsley, cilantro. Fresh herbs transform cooking and cost almost nothing to grow.

**Crops that give you the most value (expensive to buy, easy to grow):**

- Fresh herbs ($3-5/bunch at the store)
- Cherry tomatoes ($4-6/pint)
- Bell peppers ($1.50-3 each)
- Snap peas ($5-6/lb)
- Specialty lettuce ($5-7/bag)

## Succession Planting

The secret to continuous harvest is **succession planting** — sowing the same crop every 2-3 weeks instead of all at once. This is especially important for:

- Lettuce (plant every 2 weeks, March through September)
- Radishes (every 2 weeks, spring and fall)
- Green beans (plant 3 rounds, 3 weeks apart, starting at last frost)
- Beets (every 3 weeks, April through July)
- Carrots (every 3 weeks, April through July)

Without succession planting, you get a mountain of lettuce in June, nothing in July, and lettuce again in September. With it, you have salad every week.

## Crop Rotation

Rotate crop families through different beds each year. This prevents soil-borne disease buildup and balances nutrient draw. The basic rotation:

1. **Nightshades** (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes) — heavy feeders
2. **Legumes** (beans, peas) — nitrogen fixers
3. **Brassicas** (broccoli, cabbage, kale, cauliflower) — heavy feeders
4. **Root crops and alliums** (carrots, beets, onions, garlic) — light feeders

Rotate nightshades and brassicas to where legumes grew the previous year. Don't plant the same family in the same spot more than once every 3-4 years.

## Garden Layout

**Rows vs. Beds.** Traditional rows work well for large gardens with mechanical cultivation. Intensive beds (3-4 feet wide, plants spaced equidistantly) produce 2-4 times more per square foot. For most home gardeners, intensive beds are the way to go.

**Tall crops on the north side.** Plant corn, trellised tomatoes, pole beans, and sunflowers on the north edge so they don't shade shorter crops.

**Perennials separate from annuals.** Keep asparagus, rhubarb, and perennial herbs in their own dedicated area so annual garden prep doesn't disturb them.

> **Pro Tip:** Sketch your garden plan on paper or use a free tool like GrowVeg or the Old Farmer's Almanac garden planner. Record what you planted where each year. This makes crop rotation easy and helps you track what worked and what didn't.

## Common Mistakes

- **Too big too fast.** A 2,000-square-foot garden sounds great in February. By August, it's a weed-choked chore. Start with 200 square feet and expand when you're comfortable.
- **All eggs in one basket.** Planting everything the same week means everything matures the same week. Stagger your plantings.
- **Ignoring vertical space.** Trellised cucumbers, pole beans, and vining squash produce more in less ground space. Use fences, cattle panels, and string trellises.
- **No plan for fall.** The Midwest fall gardening season is nearly as productive as summer. Plan for it when you're planning spring.

# PART II: MONTH-BY-MONTH GUIDE

---

# Chapter 5: January — The Planning Month

It's January in the Midwest. The ground is frozen, the wind chill is brutal, and your garden is buried under snow. Perfect. You're exactly where you need to be: inside, with a cup of coffee and a seed catalog.

## What to Do This Month

**Order Seeds.** The best varieties sell out by February. Order now from reputable Midwest-friendly sources:

- **Johnny's Selected Seeds** — Excellent variety trials, cold-climate focus
- **Seed Savers Exchange** — Based in Decorah, Iowa (they ARE the Midwest)
- **Territorial Seed** — Good short-season varieties
- **Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds** — Based in Mansfield, Missouri
- **Fedco Seeds** — New England-based but great for cold climates
- **Jung Seed** — Based in Randolph, Wisconsin, serving the Midwest since 1907

**Review Last Season.** Pull out your garden journal (you kept one, right?) and note what worked, what failed, and what you'd change. Didn't keep a journal? Start one this year. A simple notebook is fine.

**Plan Your Layout.** Sketch your beds. Decide what goes where based on crop rotation. Estimate quantities. A common formula: grow 10-15 plants per person for canning/freezing crops (tomatoes, beans), 3-5 plants per person for fresh eating crops (peppers, eggplant).

**Check Supplies.** Inventory seed-starting supplies: trays, cell packs, sterile seed-starting mix, grow lights. Order what you need now; don't wait until March when shelves are picked over.

**Maintain Tools.** Sharpen pruners, hoes, and shovels. Oil wooden handles. Replace cracked hose washers. Clean and organize the shed or garage while you can see the floor.

**Study.** Read this book. Attend a master gardener class (most Midwest extension services run winter workshops). Join your local garden club. Learn one new technique this year — maybe drip irrigation, fermentation, or biochar.

> **Pro Tip:** When ordering seeds, check "days to maturity" religiously. In Zone 3-4, you need varieties under 70 days for warm-season crops that you direct-sow. For transplanted crops like tomatoes, you have more leeway, but an 80-day tomato still beats a 90-day tomato when September frost is coming.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting until March to order seeds.** The good stuff sells out. Order now.
- **Over-ordering.** Seed catalogs are dangerously seductive. Stick to your plan. Mostly.
- **Skipping the planning step.** Winging it leads to gaps, overlaps, and that awkward moment in June when you realize you forgot to plant beans.

# Chapter 6: February — Starting Seeds Indoors

February is when Midwest gardeners start itching. The days are getting longer, the seed catalogs have arrived, and you're ready to do something. Good news: it's time to start seeds.

## Indoor Seed Starting

**Why start indoors?** Because the Midwest growing season isn't long enough for many crops to mature from direct-sown seed. Tomatoes need 60-85 days from transplant to harvest — if you direct-sowed them at last frost (May 1-15 in Zone 5), you wouldn't pick a tomato until August at the earliest. Starting indoors gives you a 6-8 week head start.

**What to start in February:**

| Crop | Weeks Before Last Frost | Zone 5 Start Date | Zone 4 Start Date | Zone 3 Start Date |
|------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Onions (from seed) | 10-12 weeks | Feb 1-15 | Feb 15–Mar 1 | Mar 1-15 |
| Leeks | 10-12 weeks | Feb 1-15 | Feb 15–Mar 1 | Mar 1-15 |
| Celery | 10-12 weeks | Feb 1-15 | Feb 15–Mar 1 | Mar 1-15 |
| Peppers | 8-10 weeks | Feb 15–Mar 1 | Mar 1-15 | Mar 15-30 |
| Artichokes | 8-10 weeks | Feb 15–Mar 1 | Mar 1-15 | Not recommended |

**Seed-Starting Setup:**

1. **Light.** A sunny south-facing window is rarely enough — Midwest February sun is weak and days are short. Use a shop light with T5 or T8 fluorescent bulbs, or LED grow lights. Position lights 2-4 inches above seedlings, 14-16 hours per day. A timer is essential.

2. **Heat.** Most seeds germinate best at 65-80°F soil temperature. Midwest houses in February often have cold floors and windowsills. A heat mat ($20-30) under your seed trays makes a dramatic difference in germination speed and rate.

3. **Growing Medium.** Use sterile seed-starting mix, not garden soil. Garden soil compacts, drains poorly, and harbors disease organisms. A good commercial seed-starting mix is fine; making your own from equal parts peat moss (or coir), vermiculite, and perlite also works.

4. **Containers.** Cell packs, peat pots, soil blocks, or repurposed yogurt cups with drainage holes. Whatever you use, it needs drainage.

5. **Watering.** Water from the bottom by setting trays in a shallow pan of water. Top watering compacts the surface and can dislodge tiny seedlings. Keep the medium consistently moist but never waterlogged.

6. **Air Circulation.** A small fan on low speed, running intermittently, prevents damping-off disease and strengthens seedling stems. This is a Midwest seed-starting secret — stocky seedlings handle transplant shock much better than leggy ones.

> **Pro Tip:** Label everything. You think you'll remember which tray is Early Girl and which is Cherokee Purple. You won't. Use waterproof markers on plastic labels.

## Other February Tasks

- **Prune fruit trees** on a mild day (above 25°F). February and early March are ideal while trees are fully dormant.
- **Start a compost pile** if you don't have one. Layer fall leaves with kitchen scraps. It won't decompose until it thaws, but you're banking material.
- **Clean and test your grow lights.** Replace bulbs older than 2 years — fluorescents dim with age even if they still look bright.
- **Order seed potatoes, onion sets/plants, and asparagus crowns.** These are live materials with limited supply.

## Common Mistakes

- **Starting too early.** Seedlings that are too big and rootbound at transplant time perform poorly. Follow the timing chart, not your impatience.
- **Insufficient light.** Leggy, stretched seedlings reaching for a dim window are already compromised. Invest in proper lighting.
- **Overwatering.** Damping off (a fungal disease that kills seedlings at the soil line) is the #1 killer of indoor-started seedlings. Keep things moist, not soggy, and ensure air circulation.
- **Skipping hardening off.** Seedlings started indoors must be gradually acclimated to outdoor conditions over 7-10 days before transplanting. We'll cover this in detail in April.

# Chapter 7: March — Momentum Builds

March in the Midwest is a tease. One week it's 55°F and sunny; the next, you're shoveling six inches of wet snow. Don't be fooled — but don't sit still either. There's plenty to do.

## Indoor Seed Starting (Continued)

**What to start in March:**

| Crop | Weeks Before Last Frost | Zone 5 Start Date | Zone 4 Start Date |
|------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Tomatoes | 6-8 weeks | Mar 1-15 | Mar 15-30 |
| Eggplant | 8-10 weeks | Mar 1-15 | Mar 15-30 |
| Broccoli/Cauliflower/Cabbage (spring) | 6-8 weeks | Mar 1-15 | Mar 15-30 |
| Kale/Collards | 4-6 weeks | Mar 15-30 | Apr 1-15 |
| Lettuce (transplants) | 4-5 weeks | Mar 15-30 | Apr 1-15 |

March is your busiest seed-starting month. Tomatoes, eggplant, and brassicas all go in now. Make sure your lighting setup can handle the load.

## Outdoor Prep

**Soil preparation.** As soon as the ground thaws and dries enough to work (squeeze test: it should crumble, not form a ball), start preparing beds:

- Remove winter mulch or cover crop debris
- Spread compost (2-3 inches) and work it into the top 6-8 inches
- Take soil samples for testing if you haven't in 2-3 years
- Form or repair raised beds

**In Zone 6 (Southern Missouri, Southern Illinois, Southern Indiana, Southern Ohio):** You can start direct-sowing cold-hardy crops in late March:

- Peas
- Spinach
- Radishes
- Lettuce (direct-sow)
- Onion sets

These crops tolerate frost down to 25-28°F and actually prefer cool weather. They'll germinate in soil as cold as 40°F, though they prefer 50-65°F.

**In Zones 4-5:** Hold off on outdoor sowing until April. Use this time to prepare beds and get everything ready for rapid deployment when conditions allow.

## Cold Frame and Hoop House Setup

If you have a cold frame or low tunnel, March is when it earns its keep. A cold frame extends your effective season by 4-6 weeks, which in the Midwest is huge. Set them up now over prepared beds. The soil inside will warm faster than surrounding garden soil.

In a cold frame or low tunnel, you can sow lettuce, spinach, radishes, and Asian greens 3-4 weeks before you could in the open garden.

> **Pro Tip:** A simple low tunnel is a 10-foot length of 1/2-inch EMT conduit bent into a hoop, covered with 6-mil greenhouse plastic or floating row cover. Five hoops over a 4x8 bed, secured with clamps, costs under $30 and extends your season dramatically.

## Other March Tasks

- **Divide and transplant rhubarb** while dormant
- **Plant bare-root asparagus crowns** in prepared trenches (Zone 6)
- **Uncover strawberry beds** on the mild side of March
- **Set out onion transplants** (started from seed in February or purchased as plants) 4-6 weeks before last frost — that's late March in Zone 6, mid-April in Zone 5
- **Apply preemergent weed barrier** (corn gluten meal) to garden paths — it inhibits seed germination and adds nitrogen as it breaks down

## Common Mistakes

- **Working wet soil.** The #1 spring mistake in the Midwest. Wet, cold soil compacts when worked and forms clods that persist all season. Wait until it passes the squeeze test.
- **Planting warm-season crops too early.** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, and beans cannot go out until soil is consistently 60°F and night temps are reliably above 50°F. In most of the Midwest, that's late May. Patience.
- **Ignoring wind.** Cold frames and low tunnels need to be anchored. A March wind gust will send an unsecured plastic tunnel across three yards and into the neighbor's tree.

# Chapter 8: April — The Garden Wakes Up

April is electric. The soil is warming, the light is increasing, and the Midwest garden finally, truly begins. This is the month where good planning pays off and poor planning becomes obvious.

## What to Plant Outdoors in April

**Direct-sow these cold-hardy crops as soon as soil can be worked (soil temp 40°F+):**

- Peas (all types: snow, snap, shelling)
- Lettuce
- Spinach
- Radishes
- Arugula
- Kale
- Swiss chard
- Beets (soil temp 50°F+)
- Carrots (soil temp 50°F+)
- Turnips
- Kohlrabi
- Parsnips

**Transplant these (started indoors or purchased):**

- Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (4-6 weeks before last frost)
- Kale and collards
- Onion sets and transplants
- Lettuce transplants

> **Pro Tip:** For peas, soak seeds overnight in water before planting for faster germination. Then inoculate with rhizobium bacteria (sold as "pea and bean inoculant" at garden centers) for better nitrogen fixation and healthier plants.

## The Hardening Off Process

Those seedlings you started in February and March? They've never felt wind, direct sun, or cold. If you transplant them directly from your grow light to the garden, they'll sunburn, wind-burn, and possibly die.

Hardening off acclimates seedlings over 7-10 days:

1. **Days 1-2:** Set seedlings outside in a sheltered, shady spot for 2-3 hours. Bring them in at night.
2. **Days 3-4:** Increase to 4-5 hours with some morning sun.
3. **Days 5-6:** Full morning sun, 6-8 hours outside.
4. **Days 7-8:** Full sun all day, leave outside overnight if temps stay above 40°F (for cold-hardy transplants) or above 50°F (for warm-season transplants).
5. **Days 9-10:** Leave outside full time. Transplant into the garden.

Yes, it's tedious. No, you can't skip it. Plants that aren't hardened off perform poorly for weeks after transplanting, even if they survive.

## Soil Temperature Matters More Than Air Temperature

Air temperature tells you how YOU feel. Soil temperature tells you how your SEEDS feel. A sunny 60°F day means nothing if your soil is still 45°F.

Invest in a soil thermometer ($8-12). Take readings at 4 inches deep, in the morning, for three consecutive days. Use the average.

| Crop Category | Minimum Soil Temp for Germination | Optimal Soil Temp |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Cool-season (peas, lettuce, spinach) | 35-40°F | 50-65°F |
| Brassicas (broccoli, cabbage) | 40-45°F | 60-70°F |
| Root crops (carrots, beets) | 45-50°F | 60-70°F |
| Warm-season (tomatoes, peppers) | 60°F | 70-85°F |
| Very warm (squash, melons, beans) | 60-65°F | 75-90°F |

## April in Different Zones

**Zone 3 (Northern Minnesota, Northern North Dakota):** Ground may still be partially frozen in early April. Focus on indoor seed starting and preparing beds as they thaw. Direct-sow cold-hardy crops in late April if conditions allow.

**Zone 4:** Direct-sow cool-season crops mid to late April. Transplant brassicas in late April with row cover for frost protection.

**Zone 5:** Full steam ahead. Direct-sow all cool-season crops in early April. Transplant brassicas mid-April. Begin hardening off warm-season seedlings.

**Zone 6:** Cool-season crops should be in the ground by early April. Begin planting potatoes. Late April: start hardening off tomatoes and peppers for early May transplanting.

## Other April Tasks

- **Plant seed potatoes** 2-4 weeks before last frost, 4 inches deep, 12 inches apart
- **Direct-sow herb seeds:** dill, cilantro, parsley (parsley is slow — be patient)
- **Prepare tomato and pepper beds:** work in compost and balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 at 2 lbs per 100 sq ft or equivalent organic)
- **Install trellises, cages, and supports** before you need them — it's much easier now than when plants are already growing
- **Apply mulch** to established perennial beds (asparagus, rhubarb, berry patches)
- **Scout for asparagus** — in Zone 5-6, early spears may emerge in late April

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting warm-season crops.** Not yet. Not even if it's 75°F and gorgeous. One more frost is coming, and it'll kill your tomatoes without hesitation.
- **Planting peas too late.** Peas need cool weather to thrive. Planted in late April in Zone 5, they're perfect. Planted in late May, they're fighting heat and producing poorly. Get them in early.
- **Forgetting row cover.** A sheet of floating row cover ($15 for a 50-foot roll) protects transplants from light frost (down to 28°F), wind, and early insect pests. It's the most underused tool in Midwest gardening.

---

# Chapter 9: May — Game On

May is the Midwest gardener's Super Bowl. Last frost dates arrive, warm-season crops go in the ground, and the garden transforms from tentative to explosive. This is also the month where timing errors become unfixable — too early and frost kills everything, too late and you lose weeks of growing season.

## The Last Frost Date Dance

Here's the thing about "average last frost date": it's an average. Half the time, the actual last frost comes AFTER that date. Use your average date as a guideline, not a guarantee.

**Conservative approach (recommended for Zone 3-4):** Wait one week after your average last frost date before transplanting warm-season crops without protection.

**Moderate approach (Zone 5):** Plant on or near your average date, but have row cover or newspaper ready for emergency frost protection.

**Aggressive approach (Zone 6):** Plant 1-2 weeks before your average date using season extension (black plastic mulch, Wall O' Water, row cover).

## What to Plant in May

**Early May (all zones — with frost protection if needed):**

- Continue succession-sowing lettuce, radishes, beets, carrots
- Direct-sow Swiss chard
- Transplant remaining brassicas (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)
- Plant more peas (last chance — they'll struggle once temps exceed 75°F regularly)

**After Last Frost (mid-May in Zone 5, late May in Zone 4, early June in Zone 3):**

- **Transplant:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant
- **Direct-sow:** Beans (bush and pole), corn, squash (summer and winter), cucumbers, melons, pumpkins
- **Plant:** Sweet potato slips

## Transplanting Warm-Season Crops

**Tomatoes:** Plant deep — bury 2/3 of the stem. Tomatoes root along buried stems, creating a stronger, more drought-resistant plant. Remove lower leaves and set the plant in a trench or deep hole. Water with a diluted fish emulsion or starter fertilizer solution.

**Peppers:** Plant at the same depth as the pot. Peppers don't root from stems like tomatoes. They prefer warm soil — black plastic mulch under peppers increases soil temp by 5-10°F and dramatically improves performance. Space 18-24 inches apart.

**Squash and Cucumbers:** Direct-sow in hills (mounds of enriched soil, 3-4 feet apart). Plant 3-4 seeds per hill, thin to the best 2. Or transplant from pots — handle gently, as cucurbits resent root disturbance.

**Corn:** Direct-sow only. Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows (not a single long row) for proper pollination. Space seeds 8-12 inches apart in rows 30-36 inches apart. Plant when soil is 60°F+.

**Beans:** Direct-sow 1 inch deep after last frost. Bush beans: 4-6 inches apart. Pole beans: 6-8 inches apart with a sturdy trellis. Don't soak bean seeds before planting — they absorb water too quickly and crack.

## May Maintenance

- **Thin seedlings** that you direct-sowed in April. This hurts emotionally, but crowded plants produce nothing useful. Thin to recommended spacing when seedlings have 2-3 true leaves.
- **Side-dress spring brassicas** with nitrogen (blood meal, fish emulsion, or 1 tablespoon 21-0-0 per plant).
- **Weed aggressively.** May weeds grow as fast as your vegetables. Remove them when they're small — hoeing takes seconds; pulling established weeds takes minutes.
- **Monitor for cutworms.** These soil-dwelling caterpillars clip transplants at the soil line overnight. Place a collar (cardboard tube, tin can with both ends removed) around each transplant stem, pushed 1 inch into the soil.

> **Pro Tip:** Black plastic mulch transforms pepper, melon, and eggplant production in the Midwest. Lay it 2-3 weeks before transplanting to pre-warm the soil, then cut holes for transplants. It warms soil 5-10°F, suppresses weeds, and retains moisture. Pull it up in late July when you no longer need the extra heat.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting tomatoes too early.** If night temps are consistently below 50°F, tomatoes just sit there and sulk. Cold soil stunts root growth and delays maturity by weeks. Patience now equals earlier harvests later — counterintuitive but true.
- **Forgetting to cage tomatoes at planting time.** Cages installed after plants are 2 feet tall involve wrestling matches you'll lose. Put them in at planting.
- **Skipping succession planting.** Keep sowing lettuce, radishes, and beans every 2-3 weeks. Your June and July harvests depend on May sowings.
- **Neglecting to water transplants.** New transplants need consistent moisture for 2-3 weeks while roots establish. Water daily if rain doesn't cooperate.

# Chapter 10: June — Full Speed Ahead

June is when the Midwest garden goes from promising to productive. Everything is growing fast — including the weeds. Longest days of the year mean maximum photosynthesis, and warm nights finally push heat-loving crops into rapid growth.

## What to Plant in June

- **Succession-sow:** Beans (bush), beets, carrots, lettuce (heat-tolerant varieties like 'Jericho', 'Nevada', 'Muir'), radishes (daikon types for summer)
- **Direct-sow (early June):** Last round of squash and cucumbers, sunflowers
- **Start indoors (late June):** Fall brassicas — broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts. These need 6-8 weeks indoors before transplanting in August for fall harvest.

## Harvest Begins

By mid-June, you're picking:

- Lettuce, spinach, arugula (cool-season greens planted in April)
- Radishes
- Peas (snap and snow)
- Asparagus (continue cutting until June 15-20, then let ferns grow)
- Strawberries
- Green onions and scallions
- Early kale and chard

Enjoy it. This is why you did all that work.

## June Maintenance

**Weeding.** It never stops, but June is the critical month. Weeds that establish in June shade out crops and compete for water all summer. Mulch heavily (3-4 inches of straw or shredded leaves) around all plants once they're 6 inches tall. This cuts weeding time by 70-80%.

**Watering.** June rainfall varies wildly year to year. Some Junes are soaking wet; others are surprisingly dry. Monitor soil moisture and supplement as needed. Goal: 1-1.5 inches per week total (rain + irrigation).

**Fertilizing.** Side-dress heavy feeders:
- Tomatoes: When first fruits set, apply 1 tablespoon calcium nitrate per plant (prevents blossom end rot) or top-dress with compost
- Corn: When knee-high, side-dress with nitrogen (1 lb 46-0-0 per 100 row feet, or equivalent organic source)
- Peppers and eggplant: Light feeding with balanced fertilizer every 3-4 weeks

**Pest Scouting.** Walk the garden every morning. Look for:
- **Colorado potato beetles** on potatoes and eggplant — hand-pick adults and crush orange egg masses on leaf undersides
- **Cucumber beetles** (striped and spotted) — they transmit bacterial wilt, which kills cucumbers and melons. Floating row cover until flowering is the best prevention; neem or pyrethrin for severe infestations
- **Aphids** — blast off with a hose. Lady beetles will clean up what's left.
- **Squash vine borers** — the #1 squash killer in the Midwest. Adults (wasp-like moths) lay eggs at the base of stems in June. Cover stems with row cover or aluminum foil wraps. More in Chapter 19.

**Staking and Training.** Tie tomato stems to stakes or weave them through cage wires as they grow. Train pole beans and cucumbers up their trellises. Prune tomato suckers if you grow indeterminate varieties (optional but reduces disease and focuses energy on fewer, larger fruits).

> **Pro Tip:** Prune tomato plants from the ground up, removing all branches and leaves below the first fruit cluster. This "Missouri pruning" technique (yes, it's actually called that) improves air circulation and reduces soil-splash disease. Coincidence that it's named after a Midwest state? We think not.

## Common Mistakes

- **Letting peas go too long.** Once peas stop producing in the heat (usually late June), pull the plants and replant that space with beans, cucumbers, or fall carrots. Don't waste the space.
- **Under-mulching.** If you can see bare soil in June, you're going to have a weed problem in July.
- **Ignoring early pest signs.** A few cucumber beetles in June become a dead cucumber plant in July. Act early.
- **Forgetting about fall.** Start fall brassica seeds indoors in late June. It feels wrong to be starting seeds when your garden is booming, but the timing is non-negotiable.

---

# Chapter 11: July — The Heat Is On

July is the Midwest at full intensity. Temperatures regularly hit 90-100°F, humidity makes the air feel like soup, and your garden is either thriving or struggling — often both at the same time, in adjacent rows.

## What to Do in July

**Harvest.** July is peak harvest for:
- Tomatoes (first ripes in early to mid-July for most zones)
- Cucumbers (pick daily when they're producing)
- Zucchini and summer squash (check every day — a zucchini goes from perfect to baseball bat in 48 hours)
- Green beans (bush beans peak now)
- Peppers (first harvests of bell and hot varieties)
- Herbs (basil, dill, cilantro — harvest frequently to prevent bolting)
- Beets and carrots (from April sowings)
- Onions (when tops fall over, cure in a dry shaded area for 2-3 weeks)

**Plant for Fall:**
- Direct-sow fall carrots and beets (July 1-15 for Zone 5)
- Succession-sow bush beans (last sowing — count back from first fall frost, beans need 55-65 days)
- Direct-sow fall lettuce and spinach in shade or under shade cloth (too hot for germination in full sun — start them in flats or provide afternoon shade)
- Plant fall cucumbers (early July — they have time to produce before frost)
- Transplant fall brassica seedlings into the garden in late July (Zone 6) or early August (Zone 5)

## Managing Heat Stress

When temps exceed 90°F consistently:

- **Tomatoes drop blossoms.** There's nothing you can do about this except wait for temps to drop. Fruit already set continues developing; new flowers just won't pollinate. Don't panic — production will resume when nights cool below 75°F.
- **Lettuce and spinach bolt.** Spring crops are done. Replace with heat-tolerant varieties sown for fall.
- **Water demand spikes.** Plants may need 2 inches per week. Water deeply in the morning. Evening watering is second-best. Midday watering is wasteful but not harmful — the "water droplets burn leaves" myth is false.
- **Mulch pays off.** Those 3-4 inches of straw you applied in June are now keeping soil 10-15°F cooler than bare ground and retaining critical moisture.

**Shade Cloth.** A 30-50% shade cloth over lettuce, spinach, and other greens extends their production through July heat. Simple to set up: drape over hoops or a frame. Remove when temps moderate.

## July Pest and Disease Pressure

The combination of heat and humidity makes July the peak month for:

- **Tomato diseases:** Early blight (brown spots with concentric rings on lower leaves), Septoria leaf spot (small spots with gray centers), and late blight (the nuclear option — large, dark, greasy-looking lesions that destroy plants in days). Remove and destroy affected leaves immediately. Don't compost them. Copper fungicide spray is preventive, not curative — apply before symptoms appear on remaining healthy tissue.

- **Powdery mildew** on squash, cucumbers, and pumpkins. White powdery coating on leaves. Won't usually kill the plant but reduces vigor and yield. Improve air circulation (prune crowded foliage), avoid overhead watering, and apply potassium bicarbonate spray or neem oil weekly.

- **Japanese beetles.** These iridescent green-and-copper pests devour bean leaves, grape leaves, and rose bushes. Hand-pick into soapy water early morning when they're sluggish. Japanese beetle traps attract more beetles than they catch — skip them.

- **Squash vine borers.** If you didn't protect stems in June, you'll see the damage in July: sudden wilting of an otherwise healthy squash plant. Slit the stem lengthwise at the entry point (you'll see frass — sawdust-like waste), extract the larva, and pile soil over the damaged stem to encourage re-rooting. Prevention is better — see Chapter 19.

- **Tomato hornworms.** Giant green caterpillars (3-4 inches long) that can strip a tomato plant in days. Hand-pick. If you see hornworms covered in white cocoons, leave them — those are parasitic wasp eggs that will kill the hornworm and produce beneficial wasps.

> **Pro Tip:** Early blight on tomatoes is almost inevitable in the humid Midwest. Accept it and manage it rather than trying to prevent it entirely. Remove lower leaves preemptively, maintain mulch to reduce soil splash, and apply copper or chlorothalonil fungicide every 7-10 days in wet weather. Varieties like 'Defiant PhR', 'Mountain Magic', and 'Iron Lady' have improved blight resistance.

## Common Mistakes

- **Abandoning the garden in the heat.** July is when gardens need the most attention. 15 minutes every morning keeps everything on track.
- **Over-watering in response to wilting.** Plants often wilt in midday heat even when soil moisture is adequate. Check the soil before watering. If it's moist at 2 inches deep, the plant is just hot — it'll recover by evening.
- **Not harvesting.** Unpicked zucchini, cucumbers, and beans signal plants to stop producing. Pick everything at peak size for continuous production.
- **Forgetting fall planting.** This is your last month to start fall crops in most zones. Don't miss it.

---

# Chapter 12: August — The Long Harvest

August is the month of abundance. Your kitchen counter is buried in tomatoes, the freezer is filling up, and you're leaving zucchini on your neighbors' porches under cover of darkness. The garden is peaking, but fall preparation is already underway.

## Harvesting and Preserving

**Tomatoes.** At peak production. Pick when fully colored but still slightly firm. For canning and sauce-making, process within 48 hours of picking. A single healthy indeterminate tomato plant can produce 10-20 lbs of fruit across the season — that's 60-120 lbs if you have six plants. You'll need a plan.

Preservation options:
- **Canning** (water bath for whole/diced tomatoes, pressure canning for low-acid sauces)
- **Freezing** (whole, diced, or as sauce — easiest method)
- **Dehydrating** (sun-dried or machine-dried for concentrated flavor)
- **Sauce and salsa** (cook in bulk, freeze or can)

**Cucumbers.** Peak picking. Make refrigerator pickles (dead simple, no canning required) or fermented pickles (traditional and delicious).

**Beans.** Bush beans from your last succession sowing are producing. Blanch and freeze for winter use.

**Peppers.** Peak harvest for bell peppers. Let some ripen to red, orange, or yellow for sweetest flavor. Hot peppers can be dried, frozen, or made into hot sauce.

**Sweet Corn.** If you planted it, August is prime time. Pick when silks are brown and dry, kernels are plump, and a pierced kernel releases milky (not clear) liquid. Get it from stalk to pot in under 30 minutes for best flavor — sugar converts to starch rapidly after picking.

## Fall Garden Push

**August plantings for fall harvest:**

| Crop | Direct-Sow Date (Zone 5) | Direct-Sow Date (Zone 4) |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Lettuce | Aug 1-15 | July 15–Aug 1 |
| Spinach | Aug 1-15 | July 15–Aug 1 |
| Radishes | Aug 15–Sept 1 | Aug 1-15 |
| Turnips | Aug 1-15 | July 15–Aug 1 |
| Kale | Aug 1-15 (transplant) | July 15–Aug 1 (transplant) |
| Broccoli | Aug 1-15 (transplant) | July 15–Aug 1 (transplant) |
| Garlic | Wait — plant in October | Wait — plant in October |

**Transplant fall brassicas** into spaces vacated by spent crops. Where peas or spring lettuce grew, now plant broccoli, cauliflower, or cabbage transplants. Add compost to the empty spot before replanting.

**Sow cover crops** in areas that are done producing for the year. Winter rye can be sown anytime August through October and will germinate quickly, protect soil from erosion, and add organic matter when turned under in spring.

## August Maintenance

- **Continue watering.** August drought stress is common, especially in the western Midwest. Don't back off irrigation just because the calendar says summer is winding down.
- **Monitor for late-season pests.** Cabbage worms on fall brassicas, corn earworms on late corn, and spider mites on beans and tomatoes (look for fine webbing and yellowing leaves).
- **Remove spent plants.** When a crop is done, pull it out, compost the plant material (unless diseased), and either replant the space or sow a cover crop.
- **Stop fertilizing tomatoes** by mid-August. Late fertilization encourages new growth that won't have time to produce ripe fruit before frost. Let plants focus energy on ripening existing fruit.

> **Pro Tip:** In late August, "top" your indeterminate tomato plants by cutting off the growing tip. This stops new growth and redirects the plant's energy into ripening the fruit already on the vine. Count back 6-8 weeks from your average first frost to determine your topping date.

## Common Mistakes

- **Letting the garden go.** The "August slump" is real — you're tired, it's hot, and you've been at this for months. Push through. Fall gardens are some of the most rewarding in the Midwest.
- **Not planning for frost protection.** First frost is 6-8 weeks away in most zones. Have row cover, old sheets, or tarps ready for emergency coverage.
- **Wasting excess produce.** If you're overwhelmed, give it away, take it to a food bank, or learn a new preservation method. Don't let it rot on the counter.
- **Forgetting garlic.** Note: garlic goes in the ground in October, not now. But order your seed garlic in August because the best varieties sell out quickly.

# Chapter 13: September — The Turn

September in the Midwest is bittersweet. The quality of light changes, nights cool off, and the garden begins its slow, beautiful wind-down. But don't be fooled by the melancholy — September is one of the most productive months in the Midwest garden.

## The Fall Harvest

Cool nights bring out the best in many crops:

- **Tomatoes** are still producing, and cooler temps improve flavor. Watch the forecast — first frost may arrive this month in Zone 3-4.
- **Winter squash and pumpkins** — harvest when the stem dries and the skin is hard enough that you can't dent it with a fingernail. Leave 2-3 inches of stem attached. Cure in the sun for a week (or in a warm, dry room if frost threatens) for best storage life.
- **Fall lettuce, kale, and spinach** planted in August are hitting their stride now. Cool weather makes them sweeter and more tender than anything you grew in spring.
- **Broccoli and cauliflower** from August transplants begin heading.
- **Sweet potatoes** — harvest before first frost. Cure at 80-85°F and high humidity for 10 days before storage.
- **Root crops** — carrots, beets, turnips, and parsnips can stay in the ground through light frost. In fact, frost improves their flavor by converting starch to sugar.

## Frost Preparation

Know your first frost date and work backward:

| Zone | Average First Fall Frost |
|------|------------------------|
| Zone 3 | September 10-25 |
| Zone 4 | September 20 – October 5 |
| Zone 5 | October 1-15 |
| Zone 6 | October 15 – November 1 |

**Before first frost:**
1. Harvest all ripe and nearly ripe tomatoes. Green tomatoes can ripen indoors — place them in a single layer in a box with a banana (ethylene gas speeds ripening).
2. Harvest all peppers, eggplant, and basil (these are destroyed by frost).
3. Harvest winter squash and pumpkins.
4. Cover anything you want to keep growing with row cover or old sheets for the first 1-2 frosts. Often, the first frost is followed by 2-4 weeks of mild weather (Indian summer). Protecting crops through that first frost buys significant additional harvest.

**After first frost:**
- Cold-hardy crops keep going: kale, collards, Brussels sprouts, parsnips, carrots, turnips, spinach (with protection). These actually taste better after frost.
- Remove and compost frost-killed plants (tomatoes, peppers, basil, beans, squash). Don't compost diseased material — bag it and dispose separately.

## Planting in September

**Garlic.** Not yet — wait until October. But prepare your garlic bed now: work in 2-3 inches of compost and a generous helping of bone meal (2-3 lbs per 100 sq ft).

**Cover Crops.** Sow winter rye, winter wheat, or crimson clover in all cleared garden areas. These will germinate in fall, go dormant over winter, and resume growth in early spring.

**Spring Bulbs.** Not vegetables, but if you grow them, plant daffodils, tulips, and allium bulbs in September and October.

## September Maintenance

- **Reduce watering** as temperatures drop and harvest winds down. Plants need less water in cooler weather with shorter days.
- **Continue harvesting** everything at peak for maximum production.
- **Save seeds** from your best open-pollinated (not hybrid) plants. Tomato seeds need fermentation (scoop pulp and seeds into a jar of water, let sit 3-5 days until a mold layer forms, then rinse and dry). Bean and pepper seeds can be dried on the plant.
- **Begin cleaning up.** Remove spent plants, pull stakes, empty containers.
- **Take notes.** What worked? What didn't? What would you do differently? Write it down now while it's fresh.

> **Pro Tip:** Don't pull carrots and parsnips before frost if you can help it. A few hard frosts convert starches to sugars and produce the sweetest roots you've ever tasted. In Zone 5-6, you can leave them in the ground through November under heavy mulch and dig as needed. In Zone 3-4, harvest before the ground freezes solid.

## Common Mistakes

- **Giving up too early.** September is NOT the end of the garden. With frost protection, you have weeks of productive growing ahead.
- **Leaving spent plants in the ground.** Dead plants harbor disease organisms and pest eggs that overwinter. Clean up promptly.
- **Missing the cover crop window.** Cover crops need 4-6 weeks of growth before hard freeze to establish. In most of the Midwest, September is the last reliable window. Don't skip this — it's the single best thing you can do for next year's soil.
- **Not noting your actual frost dates.** Record the date of your first and last frost every year. After 3-5 years, you'll have better data than any zone chart.

# Chapter 14: October — The Wind-Down

October in the Midwest is gorgeous — crisp air, vivid color, and the satisfying feeling of a season completed. Your main task now is putting the garden to bed properly and planting one very important crop.

## Plant Garlic

October is garlic month. This is the single most important planting of the fall.

**Timing:** Plant 4-6 weeks before the ground freezes — typically mid-October in Zones 3-4, late October in Zone 5, and early November in Zone 6. You want the cloves to develop roots but not significant top growth before winter.

**How to Plant:**
1. Separate garlic bulbs into individual cloves. Use only the largest, healthiest cloves for planting. Eat the small ones.
2. Plant each clove 2-3 inches deep, pointed end up, 6-8 inches apart, in rows 12 inches apart.
3. Water in well.
4. Mulch with 4-6 inches of straw or shredded leaves. This is critical — mulch insulates against Midwest winter cold and prevents frost heaving.

**Varieties for the Midwest:**
- **Hardneck types** are best for Zones 3-5. They're winter-hardy and produce scapes (edible flower stalks) in spring. Top picks: 'Music', 'German Extra Hardy', 'Chesnok Red', 'Spanish Roja'.
- **Softneck types** work in Zone 6 and warmer microclimates. They store longer and can be braided. Try 'Inchelium Red' or 'Silverskin'.

> **Pro Tip:** Order seed garlic from a reputable grower, not the grocery store. Grocery store garlic is often treated with growth inhibitors and may carry disease. Good sources: Filaree Garlic Farm, Territorial Seed, and Seed Savers Exchange.

## Continuing Fall Harvest

October is prime time for:
- **Kale** — Frost-sweetened kale is a revelation. Harvest outer leaves and plants keep producing into November.
- **Brussels sprouts** — Best after frost. Harvest from the bottom of the stalk upward.
- **Root crops** — Continue harvesting carrots, beets, turnips, parsnips as needed. In Zone 5-6, these can stay in the ground under mulch through November or even December.
- **Late lettuce and spinach** — Under row cover, these produce well into October in most zones.
- **Herbs** — Make one last big harvest of parsley, thyme, sage, and rosemary. Dry or freeze for winter use. Bring rosemary indoors — it won't survive Midwest winters.

## Garden Cleanup

**Remove all spent plants.** Compost healthy material. Bag and discard anything that was diseased (especially tomato plants with blight, squash with powdery mildew).

**Pull supports.** Clean tomato cages, stakes, and trellises before storing. A spray of diluted bleach solution (1:9) kills lingering disease organisms.

**Turn off and drain irrigation.** Drain hoses, drip lines, and timers before frost damages them. Store indoors or in a shed.

**Add amendments.** Fall is a great time to add lime (if soil test indicates low pH) because it needs months to react. Spread compost on beds — 2-3 inches, leave on the surface. Winter weather will work it into the soil.

**Mow cover crops** if they're getting too tall (over 8-10 inches). A mow won't kill them; it keeps them manageable and encourages root growth.

## Other October Tasks

- **Dig and store tender bulbs:** Cannas, dahlias, gladiolus. Let them dry, then store in peat moss in a cool (40-50°F), dark place.
- **Protect young fruit trees** with tree wraps to prevent sunscald and rabbit damage over winter.
- **Plant trees and shrubs.** October is ideal for planting in the Midwest — roots establish in cool, moist soil.
- **Organize your seed stash.** Check expiration dates, consolidate, and list what you need to order for next year.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting garlic too late.** Cloves need 4-6 weeks to root before hard freeze. Too late and they winter-kill.
- **Skipping the mulch on garlic.** Unmulched garlic in Zones 3-5 is at serious risk from frost heaving and extreme cold. Mulch heavily.
- **Leaving diseased plants to overwinter.** Disease spores overwinter in plant debris and reinfect next year's garden. Clean up thoroughly.
- **Not draining irrigation.** Frozen water splits hoses, cracks fittings, and ruins timers. It takes 15 minutes to drain everything. Do it.

# Chapter 15: November — Putting the Garden to Bed

November is quiet. The first hard freeze has shut down most of the garden, the leaves are down, and the Midwest is settling into its winter posture. Your work this month is about closing out the season cleanly and setting up for next year.

## Final Harvests

**Root crops.** In Zone 5-6, you can still dig carrots, parsnips, and turnips through November if the ground hasn't frozen. Mulch the bed heavily (6-8 inches of straw) and dig as needed through early December.

**Kale and collards.** These tough greens survive temperatures into the low 20s. In a cold frame, they'll last well into December.

**Brussels sprouts.** The last vegetable standing in many Midwest gardens. Harvest stalks before temps drop below 15-20°F.

**Herbs.** Sage and thyme often survive into November. One last harvest before hard freeze.

## Final Garden Tasks

**Spread leaves.** Those fall leaves you raked? They're garden gold. Shred them with a mower and spread 3-4 inches over all garden beds. They decompose over winter, adding organic matter and protecting soil from erosion. Free mulch, delivered by trees, every single year.

**Compost maintenance.** Turn your compost pile one last time. It'll slow down dramatically in winter but won't stop entirely — the core of a well-built pile stays above freezing even in January.

**Soil testing.** If you didn't test in spring, fall is actually a better time. Results come back quickly (labs aren't swamped), and you have all winter to plan amendments.

**Tool maintenance.** Clean, sharpen, and oil all hand tools. Drain and store hoses. Service your tiller or mower if applicable. Properly maintained tools last decades.

**Review and plan.** Start thinking about next year. What varieties do you want to try? What beds need crop rotation? Any infrastructure improvements (new raised beds, irrigation upgrades, fencing)?

> **Pro Tip:** Late November through December is the perfect time to build new raised beds. The ground is firm, you're not disrupting active gardens, and the beds will be ready for spring planting. Fill them in fall and let winter weather settle the soil.

## Common Mistakes

- **Leaving bare soil exposed all winter.** Erosion and nutrient loss are real. Cover every inch with mulch, leaves, or cover crops.
- **Not preserving your harvest data.** Write down what you planted, when, varieties, yields, and observations. This information is priceless for future planning.
- **Neglecting perennials.** Cut back asparagus ferns after they yellow. Apply 4-6 inches of mulch over strawberry beds after 3-4 hard frosts. Protect raspberry canes from rabbit browse.

# Chapter 16: December — Rest and Dream

December in the Midwest garden is stillness. The ground is frozen, snow covers the beds, and the garden rests. So should you — but with a seed catalog in hand.

## What to Do in December

**Order seed catalogs.** If you didn't in November, request catalogs now. Most arrive within 1-2 weeks.

**Review your garden journal.** What were your best crops? Your biggest disappointments? Quantify your harvest if you can — "we picked X pounds of tomatoes" is more useful than "we grew lots of tomatoes."

**Plan next year's garden.** Start your layout, research new varieties, and plan crop rotation.

**Give garden gifts.** Seed collections, gardening books, quality hand tools, and gift certificates to seed companies make excellent holiday presents.

**Check stored produce.** Inspect winter squash, root vegetables, garlic, onions, and any canned goods for spoilage. Remove anything that's going soft.

**Maintain your compost.** Add kitchen scraps. The pile won't process much, but you're banking material for spring decomposition.

**Prune dormant fruit trees and berry bushes** (after leaf drop, before extreme cold). Apple and pear trees, grapevines, and blueberry bushes are best pruned in late December through February.

> **Pro Tip:** Use December to sketch your garden map for next year. Color-code by crop family (nightshades = red, brassicas = green, legumes = brown, roots = orange). This makes rotation obvious and planning visual.

## Common Mistakes

- **Waiting until spring to plan.** By March, you're scrambling. December planning is relaxed planning, and relaxed planning is good planning.
- **Forgetting to check stored produce.** One rotting butternut squash in your basement can spoil the ones next to it. Inspect monthly.
- **Letting ambition outrun ability.** Those seed catalog photos are intoxicating. Stay realistic about your time, space, and energy.

# PART III: VEGETABLE PROFILES

---

# Chapter 17: Warm-Season Vegetables A-Z

These crops need warm soil (60°F+) and warm air (consistently above 50°F at night) to thrive. In the Midwest, they go outdoors after last frost and are killed by first fall frost. Your job is to maximize their time in the ground.

---

## Beans (Bush and Pole)

**Zones:** All Midwest zones
**Days to Maturity:** Bush: 50-60 days; Pole: 60-70 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow after last frost, 1 inch deep. Soil temp 60°F+.

Bush beans are the workhorses of the Midwest garden. They're foolproof, prolific, and freeze beautifully. Plant a 10-foot row and you'll pick for 2-3 weeks. Plant succession rounds 3 weeks apart for continuous harvest into September.

Pole beans take longer to start but produce over a longer period from a single planting. They need a sturdy support — a teepee of poles, a section of cattle panel, or a string trellis at least 6 feet tall.

**Spacing:** Bush: 4-6 inches apart, rows 18-24 inches apart. Pole: 6-8 inches apart along trellis.

**Water:** 1 inch/week. Consistent moisture during flowering and pod set is critical — drought stress during flowering causes poor pod fill.

**Fertilizer:** Light. Beans fix their own nitrogen. A light side-dress of balanced fertilizer at flowering is all they need.

**Harvest:** Pick when pods are firm and crisp but before seeds bulge visibly. Pick every 2-3 days to keep plants producing. For dry beans, let pods dry on the plant until they rattle.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Bush:** 'Provider' (reliable, cold-tolerant), 'Contender', 'Blue Lake 274', 'Roma II' (flat Italian type)
- **Pole:** 'Kentucky Wonder', 'Fortex' (long French type), 'Rattlesnake'

**Common Mistakes:** Planting in cold soil (beans rot). Letting pods get too large (tough and mealy). Not inoculating with rhizobium bacteria.

---

## Corn (Sweet)

**Zones:** All, but most productive in Zones 4-6
**Days to Maturity:** 60-100 days depending on variety
**Plant:** Direct-sow after last frost, 1 inch deep. Soil temp 60°F+ (65°F+ preferred).

Corn takes space, but nothing from a farm stand matches a just-picked ear from your garden. The sugar-to-starch conversion that starts at picking means truly fresh corn is a completely different vegetable than store-bought.

**Spacing:** 8-12 inches apart in rows 30-36 inches apart. Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows for pollination — corn is wind-pollinated, and single rows pollinate poorly, giving you partially filled ears.

**Water:** 1.5 inches/week, especially during tasseling and silking (the critical pollination period). Drought stress during silking causes missing kernels.

**Fertilizer:** Heavy feeder. Work in 2-3 lbs of 10-10-10 per 100 sq ft at planting. Side-dress with nitrogen when plants are knee-high (about 12-18 inches) — 1 lb of 46-0-0 or 3 lbs blood meal per 100 row feet.

**Harvest:** When silks turn brown and dry (typically 18-21 days after silking). Pull back husk slightly and press a kernel — milky juice means ready, clear juice means wait, pasty means you're too late.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Standard (su):** 'Golden Bantam' (heirloom, 78 days)
- **Sugar-enhanced (se):** 'Bodacious' (75 days), 'Kandy Korn' (89 days)
- **Supersweet (sh2):** 'Honey Select' (79 days), 'Xtra Tender' (82 days)
- **Short-season:** 'Early Sunglow' (63 days), 'Trinity' (68 days)

**Common Mistakes:** Single-row planting (poor pollination). Planting in cold soil (poor germination). Mixing supersweet with other types (cross-pollination ruins flavor). Not providing enough nitrogen.

---

## Cucumbers

**Zones:** All Midwest zones
**Days to Maturity:** 50-70 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow after last frost, or transplant (handle gently). Soil temp 65°F+.

Cucumbers are heat-loving but fast-maturing, making them ideal for Midwest summers. Vining types are more productive; bush types work for containers and small spaces.

**Spacing:** Hills: 3-4 plants per hill, hills 4-6 feet apart. Trellised: 12 inches apart. Bush types: 24-36 inches apart.

**Water:** Consistent moisture is critical. Drought stress causes bitter fruit. 1-1.5 inches/week, more in hot weather. Drip irrigation preferred — wet leaves invite disease.

**Fertilizer:** Moderate feeder. Side-dress with compost or balanced fertilizer when vines begin to run and again when first fruits set.

**Harvest:** Slicing types: 6-8 inches. Pickling types: 2-4 inches. Pick every 1-2 days when producing. Overripe cucumbers (yellow, seedy) signal the plant to stop producing.

**Trellising:** Vertical growing saves space, improves air circulation, and produces straighter fruit. A panel of welded wire fencing or cattle panel works perfectly.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Slicing:** 'Marketmore 76' (reliable, disease-resistant), 'Straight Eight', 'Diva' (burpless, all-female)
- **Pickling:** 'National Pickling', 'Calypso', 'Boston Pickling'
- **Specialty:** 'Suyo Long' (Asian type, heat-tolerant), 'Lemon' (round, yellow, mild)

**Common Mistakes:** Letting fruit get too large. Overhead watering (promotes disease). Not providing support (ground-grown cukes get belly rot). Ignoring cucumber beetles (they transmit bacterial wilt — game over for the plant).

---

## Eggplant

**Zones:** Best in Zones 5-6; challenging in Zones 3-4
**Days to Maturity:** 60-80 days from transplant
**Plant:** Transplant only — start indoors 8-10 weeks before last frost. Soil temp 70°F+ preferred.

Eggplant is the diva of the Midwest garden. It wants heat — more heat than the Midwest reliably provides. But with black plastic mulch, a warm microclimate, and the right variety, Midwest gardeners can produce beautiful eggplant.

**Spacing:** 18-24 inches apart, rows 30-36 inches apart.

**Water:** 1-1.5 inches/week. Consistent moisture for smooth, glossy fruit.

**Fertilizer:** Moderate feeder. Side-dress with balanced fertilizer every 3-4 weeks.

**Harvest:** When skin is glossy and firm and fruit springs back slightly when pressed. Dull skin means overripe and seedy. Cut (don't pull) with a sharp knife, leaving 1 inch of stem.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- 'Black Beauty' (classic, 73 days)
- 'Ichiban' (Japanese, long and slender, 61 days — great for short seasons)
- 'Orient Express' (65 days, excellent for Zone 4-5)
- 'Hansel' (mini, 55 days, perfect for containers)
- 'Rosa Bianca' (Italian heirloom, beautiful, 75 days — Zone 5-6 only)

**Common Mistakes:** Transplanting into cold soil (plants stall and may never recover). Not using black plastic mulch (the single biggest yield booster for eggplant in the Midwest). Letting flea beetles destroy seedlings (use row cover until flowering).

---

## Melons (Cantaloupe and Watermelon)

**Zones:** Best in Zones 5-6; possible in Zone 4 with season extension
**Days to Maturity:** Cantaloupe: 75-90 days. Watermelon: 70-90 days.
**Plant:** Direct-sow after last frost when soil is 70°F+, or transplant 3-4 week old seedlings.

Melons are the ultimate Midwest gardening challenge. They need heat, space, and time — all things the Midwest provides grudgingly. But a vine-ripened cantaloupe from your own garden is worth the effort.

**Spacing:** Hills 4-6 feet apart (muskmelons), 6-8 feet apart (watermelons). 2-3 plants per hill.

**Water:** 1-2 inches/week during growth. Reduce watering as fruit approaches ripeness for concentrated flavor. Drip irrigation only — wet foliage destroys melons via fungal disease.

**Fertilizer:** Heavy feeders. Amend hills with generous compost before planting. Side-dress with balanced fertilizer when vines run and when first fruit sets.

**Season Extension:** Black plastic mulch under plants is almost essential in Zones 4-5. Row cover over young plants adds warmth and wind protection. Remove row cover when flowers open for pollination.

**Harvest:** Cantaloupe: ripe when the stem slips easily from the fruit with gentle pressure and the blossom end smells sweet. Watermelon: ripe when the ground spot turns from white to creamy yellow, the tendril nearest the fruit turns brown, and the melon sounds hollow when thumped.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Cantaloupe:** 'Minnesota Midget' (60 days — bred for the Midwest!), 'Sugar Cube' (80 days, disease-resistant), 'Athena' (75 days, commercial standard)
- **Watermelon:** 'Sugar Baby' (75 days, compact), 'Blacktail Mountain' (70 days, cold-tolerant — developed in Idaho for short seasons), 'Crimson Sweet' (85 days, Zone 5-6)

**Common Mistakes:** Starting too late (melons need every day you can give them). Not using plastic mulch. Overwatering near harvest (dilutes flavor). Planting in shade (melons need full, blazing sun).

---

## Peppers (Sweet and Hot)

**Zones:** All, with variety selection
**Days to Maturity:** 60-90 days from transplant
**Plant:** Transplant only — start indoors 8-10 weeks before last frost. Wait 2 weeks after last frost to transplant (peppers want warm soil and air).

Peppers are the second most popular warm-season crop in the Midwest (after tomatoes), and for good reason. They're productive, compact, and relatively trouble-free once established.

**Spacing:** 18-24 inches apart, rows 24-36 inches apart.

**Water:** 1-1.5 inches/week. Consistent moisture prevents blossom end rot. Avoid overhead watering.

**Fertilizer:** Moderate. Too much nitrogen produces beautiful plants with no fruit. Use a low-nitrogen, higher-phosphorus fertilizer (like 5-10-10) after first fruit set.

**Harvest:** Peppers are edible at any size once they reach mature dimensions. Green bell peppers are simply unripe; if you leave them on the plant, they'll turn red, orange, or yellow (depending on variety) and become sweeter. Hot peppers intensify in heat as they ripen.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Sweet Bell:** 'Ace' (early, 60 days — essential for Zone 3-4), 'King of the North' (68 days, bred for cold climates), 'Red Knight' (72 days, disease-resistant)
- **Sweet Other:** 'Carmen' (Italian frying, 75 days), 'Shishito' (60 days), 'Lunchbox' (mini sweet, 75 days)
- **Hot:** 'Jalapeño Early' (65 days), 'Hungarian Hot Wax' (70 days), 'Cayenne' (72 days), 'Habanero' (90 days — Zone 5-6 only, or container-grown and moved indoors to ripen)

> **Pro Tip:** In Zones 3-4, peppers benefit enormously from black plastic mulch and a row cover tunnel for the first 2-3 weeks after transplant. The combination warms both soil and air, effectively creating Zone 6 conditions for your peppers.

**Common Mistakes:** Transplanting too early (cold nights below 50°F stunt peppers permanently). Over-fertilizing with nitrogen. Not staking or caging heavy-laden plants (branches snap under fruit weight).

---

## Pumpkins and Winter Squash

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 85-120 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow after last frost when soil is 65°F+, or transplant 3-4 week seedlings.

Pumpkins and winter squash are quintessential Midwest crops. They need space, warmth, and patience — and they deliver a pantry full of food that stores for months without refrigeration.

**Spacing:** Bush types: 3-4 feet apart. Vining types: 6-10 feet between hills.

**Water:** 1.5 inches/week. Deep, infrequent watering encourages deep roots. Reduce water as fruit matures.

**Fertilizer:** Heavy feeders. Build hills with compost and balanced fertilizer. Side-dress monthly.

**Harvest:** When rinds are hard (can't dent with a fingernail) and stems are dry and corky. Cut stems — don't tear. Leave 2-3 inches of stem for better storage. Cure in the sun for 7-10 days (or indoors at 80°F). Properly cured winter squash stores 3-6 months at 50-55°F.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Pumpkins:** 'Jack Be Little' (mini, 90 days), 'New England Pie' (100 days, excellent cooking), 'Howden' (115 days, classic jack-o-lantern)
- **Butternut:** 'Waltham Butternut' (100 days, stores beautifully), 'Butterbush' (75 days, compact vine)
- **Acorn:** 'Table Queen' (80 days), 'Honey Bear' (85 days, compact)
- **Other:** 'Delicata' (100 days, easy to cook), 'Red Kuri' (92 days, nutty flavor), 'Spaghetti Squash' (88 days)
- **Short-season:** 'Baby Pam' (100 days pumpkin), 'Ponca' (85 days butternut)

**Common Mistakes:** Not enough space (vining pumpkins can travel 20+ feet). Forgetting squash vine borers (see Chapter 19). Harvesting before fully cured. Not leaving enough stem.

---

## Summer Squash and Zucchini

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 45-55 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow after last frost, or transplant. Soil temp 65°F+.

The most productive vegetable per plant in the garden. Two zucchini plants will feed a family of four all summer and generate enough surplus to test every friendship you have. Plant three and you'll resort to leaving them in unlocked cars in the church parking lot.

**Spacing:** 24-36 inches apart, or 2-3 plants per hill with hills 4 feet apart.

**Water:** 1-1.5 inches/week. Water at the base — powdery mildew loves wet squash leaves.

**Fertilizer:** Moderate to heavy. Side-dress with compost or balanced fertilizer every 3-4 weeks.

**Harvest:** Zucchini: 6-8 inches. Yellow squash: 4-6 inches. Patty pan: 3-4 inches diameter. Check daily and harvest frequently — oversized squash are watery, seedy, and signal the plant to reduce production.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Zucchini:** 'Black Beauty' (classic, 50 days), 'Costata Romanesco' (Italian, ribbed, incredible flavor, 52 days), 'Dunja' (52 days, powdery mildew resistant)
- **Yellow:** 'Golden Zucchini', 'Early Prolific Straightneck' (50 days)
- **Patty Pan:** 'Benning's Green Tint' (52 days), 'Sunburst' (52 days, yellow)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting too many (seriously, 2-3 plants is enough for most families). Not harvesting daily. Ignoring squash vine borers and powdery mildew.

---

## Sweet Potatoes

**Zones:** Best in Zones 5-6; possible in Zone 4 with effort
**Days to Maturity:** 90-120 days from slips
**Plant:** Transplant slips (rooted cuttings) 2-3 weeks after last frost when soil is 65°F+.

Sweet potatoes are a southern crop that's increasingly popular in the Midwest thanks to short-season varieties and black plastic mulch. They need heat and a long season — every trick in Chapter 21 (Season Extension) helps.

**Spacing:** 12-18 inches apart, rows 36-48 inches apart. Plant slips on raised ridges or mounds for better drainage and warmer soil.

**Water:** 1 inch/week. Reduce in the final month before harvest — too much water causes cracking.

**Fertilizer:** Avoid high nitrogen (produces vines, not tubers). A low-nitrogen, high-potassium fertilizer (0-10-10 or similar) at planting is sufficient.

**Harvest:** Before first frost — sweet potatoes are tropical and have zero frost tolerance. Dig carefully to avoid damaging tubers. Cure at 80-85°F with high humidity for 10 days (a garage with a space heater and a damp towel works). Properly cured sweet potatoes store 4-6 months at 55-60°F.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- 'Beauregard' (90 days, standard red-orange)
- 'Georgia Jet' (90 days, cold-tolerant)
- 'Covington' (110 days, excellent flavor, Zone 5-6)
- 'Centennial' (90 days, one of the earliest)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting in cold soil. Not using black plastic mulch. Forgetting to cure (uncured sweet potatoes don't develop sweetness and rot quickly in storage).

---

## Tomatoes

**Zones:** All Midwest zones
**Days to Maturity:** 55-90 days from transplant
**Plant:** Transplant only — start indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost. Transplant after last frost when nights are consistently above 50°F.

There's a reason tomatoes are the #1 home garden crop in America: a vine-ripened homegrown tomato bears almost no resemblance to the mealy, pale offerings at the supermarket. In the Midwest, tomatoes are a passion, a hobby, and for some people, an obsession.

**Determinate vs. Indeterminate:**
- **Determinate** plants grow to a set size (3-4 feet), produce all their fruit in a concentrated 2-3 week window, then stop. Great for canning, paste, and Zone 3-4 gardeners who need fast, reliable production.
- **Indeterminate** plants grow indefinitely (6-10+ feet), produce continuously until frost, and need serious staking/caging. Better for fresh eating over a long season. Most heirloom types are indeterminate.

**Spacing:** Determinate: 24-30 inches apart. Indeterminate: 30-36 inches apart. Rows 4-5 feet apart.

**Support:** Non-negotiable. Use heavy-duty cages (not those flimsy cone-shaped things from the hardware store — they'll be flat on the ground by July), 6-foot stakes with tie material, or the Florida weave (string woven between stakes along a row).

**Planting Depth:** Bury 2/3 of the stem. This is the single best thing you can do for tomato performance. The buried stem produces adventitious roots, creating a massive root system that resists drought and feeds more fruit.

**Water:** 1-2 inches/week, consistently. Irregular watering causes blossom end rot (not a disease — a calcium transport problem caused by inconsistent moisture) and cracking (sudden water after drought). Mulch heavily and use drip irrigation.

**Fertilizer:** At planting: work in compost and 1 tablespoon of balanced granular fertilizer (10-10-10 or similar) per planting hole. When first fruit sets, side-dress with calcium nitrate (1 tablespoon per plant) or bone meal. Don't over-fertilize — too much nitrogen produces giant plants with few fruit.

**Pruning:** For indeterminate types, remove suckers (the shoots that emerge from the junction between the main stem and a branch) below the first flower cluster. Above that, let them grow or prune selectively. Determinate types: don't prune at all.

**Harvest:** Pick when fully colored and slightly soft to gentle pressure. In the Midwest, the best tomato flavor comes from the August-September harvest when warm days and cool nights concentrate sugars. At season's end, pick all mature green tomatoes — they'll ripen indoors in 1-3 weeks at room temperature.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Slicing:** 'Celebrity' (70 days, determinate, disease-resistant, bulletproof), 'Big Beef' (73 days, indeterminate, excellent all-around), 'Jet Star' (72 days, reliable), 'Better Boy' (72 days)
- **Heirloom:** 'Cherokee Purple' (80 days, incredible flavor), 'Brandywine' (80 days, classic but disease-prone), 'Black Krim' (70 days), 'Mortgage Lifter' (85 days)
- **Paste/Sauce:** 'San Marzano' (80 days, the gold standard for sauce), 'Roma VF' (75 days, determinate), 'Amish Paste' (85 days, heirloom)
- **Cherry/Grape:** 'Sun Gold' (57 days, orange, addictively sweet — the #1 cherry tomato in America), 'Juliet' (60 days, grape, prolific), 'Supersweet 100' (65 days)
- **Short-Season (Zone 3-4):** 'Stupice' (52 days, Czech heirloom, cold-tolerant), 'Sub Arctic Plenty' (45 days, determinate), 'Glacier' (55 days), 'Early Girl' (57 days)
- **Disease-Resistant:** 'Defiant PhR' (70 days, late blight resistant), 'Mountain Magic' (72 days), 'Iron Lady' (75 days, resistant to early blight, late blight, and Septoria)

> **Pro Tip:** If you grow only one tomato variety, grow 'Celebrity.' If you grow two, add 'Sun Gold.' 'Celebrity' gives you reliable, disease-resistant slicers from mid-July through frost. 'Sun Gold' gives you candy-sweet cherry tomatoes by early July that produce until hard freeze. Together, they cover all bases.

**Common Mistakes:** Planting too early in cold soil. Not providing support. Overhead watering. Ignoring early blight (it won't kill the plant immediately, but untreated, it strips the lower canopy and reduces yield by 30-50%). Planting in the same spot year after year (builds up soil-borne disease).

# Chapter 18: Cool-Season Vegetables A-Z

These crops thrive in 40-75°F temperatures. They tolerate light to moderate frost (many improve in flavor after frost), bolt in heat, and give the Midwest gardener two productive windows: spring and fall. In many cases, the fall crop is better because maturing in cooling (rather than warming) weather produces sweeter, more tender results.

---

## Beets

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 50-65 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow 2-4 weeks before last frost, and again in midsummer for fall harvest. Soil temp 50°F+.

Beets are a two-for-one crop: you eat the root AND the greens. Beet greens are delicious sautéed with garlic and olive oil, and you can start harvesting them as thinnings when plants are just a few inches tall.

**Spacing:** Sow seeds 1 inch apart, thin to 3-4 inches. Beet "seeds" are actually clusters of 2-4 seeds — you'll always need to thin.

**Water:** Consistent moisture for smooth, tender roots. 1 inch/week.

**Harvest:** Pull when roots are 1.5-3 inches diameter for best flavor and texture. Larger beets get woody. For greens, harvest outer leaves when 4-6 inches long.

**Best Midwest Varieties:** 'Detroit Dark Red' (classic), 'Chioggia' (candy-striped inside), 'Golden' (mild, doesn't stain everything), 'Cylindra' (uniform slices for canning).

**Common Mistakes:** Not thinning (produces tiny, misshapen roots). Letting fall beets freeze solid (harvest before ground freezes, or mulch heavily for in-ground storage).

---

## Broccoli and Cauliflower

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 55-80 days from transplant
**Plant:** Start indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost for spring crop; start indoors in June for fall crop.

These brassicas are fussy about temperature but spectacularly rewarding when you get the timing right. The secret in the Midwest: the fall crop is almost always better than the spring crop. Spring crops rush toward summer heat and bolt or produce tiny heads. Fall crops mature in cooling weather and produce large, tight, beautiful heads.

**Spacing:** 18-24 inches apart, rows 24-36 inches apart.

**Water:** 1-1.5 inches/week. Consistent moisture is critical during head formation.

**Fertilizer:** Heavy feeders. Work compost and balanced fertilizer into the planting hole. Side-dress with nitrogen (blood meal or fish emulsion) every 3 weeks.

**Harvest:** Broccoli: cut the central head when florets are tight and before any yellow flowers open. Leave the plant — it'll produce smaller side shoots for weeks. Cauliflower: blanch white varieties by folding outer leaves over the head and securing with a rubber band when the head is 2-3 inches across. Harvest when head is 6-8 inches, before curds start to separate.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Broccoli:** 'Waltham 29' (74 days, great for fall), 'De Cicco' (48 days, prolific side shoots), 'Belstar' (66 days, consistent performer)
- **Cauliflower:** 'Amazing' (68 days), 'Snow Crown' (50 days, fast for spring), 'Graffiti' (purple, 80 days, no blanching needed)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting spring transplants too late (they hit summer heat before heading). Starting fall plants too late (they need time to size up before frost). Not providing enough fertility.

## Cabbage

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 60-100 days from transplant
**Plant:** Transplant 4-6 weeks before last frost for spring; transplant mid-July to early August for fall.

Cabbage is one of the most cold-hardy vegetables you can grow. It tolerates frost to 20°F, stores for months in a root cellar (32-40°F), and is the foundation of sauerkraut — a Midwest preservation tradition with deep cultural roots.

**Spacing:** 12-18 inches apart for small/medium heads, 18-24 inches for large.

**Water:** 1-1.5 inches/week. Irregular watering causes heads to split.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Green:** 'Golden Acre' (65 days, compact), 'Copenhagen Market' (72 days), 'Storage No. 4' (95 days, excellent keeping)
- **Red:** 'Red Acre' (76 days), 'Ruby Perfection' (85 days)
- **Savoy:** 'Savoy King' (85 days, textured leaves, cold-hardy)
- **Napa/Chinese:** 'Blues' (57 days), 'Minuet' (48 days, mini heads)

**Common Mistakes:** Not controlling cabbage worms (handpick or use Bt spray). Splitting from heavy rain after drought — mulch and consistent water prevent this.

---

## Carrots

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 60-80 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow 2-4 weeks before last frost. Succession plant every 3 weeks through mid-July.

Carrots need loose, rock-free soil for straight roots. If you have heavy clay, grow them in raised beds or choose short/round varieties.

**Spacing:** Sow thickly, thin to 2-3 inches apart when tops are 2 inches tall. Thinning is essential — don't skip it.

**Water:** Consistent moisture for smooth, crack-free roots. Keep the soil surface moist until seeds germinate (7-21 days — carrot seeds are notoriously slow).

**Germination Trick:** Cover seeded row with a wet burlap sack or board until seeds sprout, then remove immediately. Or mix carrot seed with radish seed — radishes germinate in 4-5 days, marking the row and breaking the soil crust for carrots.

**Harvest:** Pull when tops of roots are 1/2 to 3/4 inch diameter. Fall carrots left in the ground through light frost develop outstanding sweetness. Mulch heavily and harvest through November (Zone 5-6) or until ground freezes (Zone 3-4).

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Standard:** 'Bolero' (75 days, great storage), 'Napoli' (58 days, early), 'Scarlet Nantes' (68 days, classic)
- **Short/Rocky Soil:** 'Danvers Half Long' (75 days), 'Chantenay Red Core' (70 days), 'Paris Market' (round, 60 days)
- **Fun Colors:** 'Cosmic Purple' (68 days), 'Yellowstone' (72 days), 'Rainbow Blend'

**Common Mistakes:** Planting too deep (seeds need light to germinate — cover with only 1/4 inch of fine soil). Not thinning. Rocky or compacted soil (forked, stunted roots). Giving up on germination too soon — carrots can take 3 weeks to emerge.

---

## Garlic

**Zones:** All (hardneck types for Zone 3-5; softneck for Zone 6)
**Days to Maturity:** 240+ days (October planting to July harvest)
**Plant:** Plant cloves in October, 4-6 weeks before ground freezes.

Garlic is covered in detail in Chapter 14 (October), but here's the quick profile: plant in fall, mulch heavily, ignore through winter, remove mulch in spring when shoots emerge, cut scapes in June (hardneck types), harvest when lower leaves brown in July, cure for 2-3 weeks, store for 6-10 months.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Hardneck (Zones 3-5):** 'Music' (most popular, reliable, large cloves), 'German Extra Hardy', 'Chesnok Red' (excellent roasted), 'Spanish Roja' (the "true" garlic flavor)
- **Softneck (Zone 6):** 'Inchelium Red', 'Silverskin' (stores the longest)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting grocery store garlic. Not mulching. Harvesting too late (cloves separate in the ground and won't store well).

---

## Kale

**Zones:** All — one of the hardiest vegetables for the Midwest
**Days to Maturity:** 50-65 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow or transplant 4-6 weeks before last frost for spring; direct-sow or transplant in late July/early August for fall.

Kale is the Midwest gardener's best friend. It laughs at frost, shrugs at snow, and actually tastes better after freezing temperatures convert its starches to sugars. In Zone 5-6 with a cold frame, you can harvest kale twelve months a year.

**Spacing:** 12-18 inches apart.

**Harvest:** Pick outer leaves, leaving the center growing point intact. Plants produce new leaves continuously for months. One kale plant can produce 5+ pounds of greens across a season.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- 'Winterbor' (60 days, curly, extremely cold-hardy)
- 'Lacinato/Dinosaur' (62 days, flat "dino" leaves, sweeter)
- 'Red Russian' (50 days, tender, beautiful, less cold-hardy)
- 'Dwarf Blue Curled' (55 days, compact, perfect for small gardens)

**Common Mistakes:** Only growing kale in spring (fall kale is FAR superior). Not controlling aphids (blast with water or use insecticidal soap). Harvesting the center growing point (kills continued production).

---

## Lettuce and Salad Greens

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 30-60 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow or transplant 4-6 weeks before last frost. Succession-plant every 2 weeks. Resume fall sowing in August.

Lettuce is the best argument for a home garden in the Midwest. A $2 packet of seed produces more salad than a $50 grocery bill, and it takes up almost no space.

**Types:**
- **Loose-leaf:** Fastest (30-45 days), cut-and-come-again harvesting, heat-tolerant varieties available
- **Butterhead/Bibb:** Tender, mild, beautiful heads (55-60 days)
- **Romaine:** Upright, crunchy, nutritious (60-70 days)
- **Crisphead/Iceberg:** The hardest to grow in the Midwest — needs a long cool period that's rare here. Skip it unless you're in Zone 3.

**Spacing:** Loose-leaf: 4-6 inches. Heading types: 8-12 inches.

**Water:** Consistent moisture for tender leaves. Drought-stressed lettuce is bitter.

**Heat Management:** Lettuce bolts (sends up a flower stalk, leaves become bitter) when temperatures consistently exceed 80°F. Solutions: grow heat-tolerant varieties ('Jericho', 'Nevada', 'Muir'), provide afternoon shade or shade cloth, and focus lettuce production in spring and fall when conditions are ideal.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Loose-leaf:** 'Salad Bowl' (green), 'Red Sails' (red), 'Black Seeded Simpson' (fast, reliable)
- **Butterhead:** 'Buttercrunch' (classic), 'Skyphos' (red butterhead)
- **Romaine:** 'Parris Island Cos' (classic), 'Jericho' (heat-tolerant)
- **Heat-tolerant:** 'Nevada' (summer lettuce), 'Muir' (bolt-resistant)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting all lettuce at once (2-week succession is the way). Growing lettuce in midsummer full sun (it bolts immediately). Not watering consistently.

---

## Onions

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 90-120 days from transplants/sets; 150+ from seed
**Plant:** Start from seed indoors 10-12 weeks before last frost (February), OR plant sets/transplants 4-6 weeks before last frost (April).

Onions are categorized by day length:
- **Long-day:** Need 14-16 hours of daylight to bulb. Best for Zone 3-5 (most of the Midwest).
- **Intermediate-day:** Need 12-14 hours. Work in Zone 5-6.
- **Short-day:** Won't bulb properly in the Midwest. Don't plant them.

**Spacing:** 4-6 inches apart, rows 12 inches apart.

**Water:** 1 inch/week until bulbs begin to enlarge, then reduce. When tops start falling over, stop watering entirely and let them cure.

**Harvest:** When 50% of tops have fallen over naturally, bend the rest down by hand. Let dry in the field for a day, then cure in a warm, dry, shaded area for 2-3 weeks. Properly cured onions store 3-6 months.

**Best Midwest Varieties (Long-Day):**
- 'Walla Walla' (sweet, mild, doesn't store long)
- 'Copra' (excellent storage, 104 days)
- 'Patterson' (best storage onion available)
- 'Redwing' (red, good storage)
- 'Ailsa Craig' (exhibition-size sweet onion)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting short-day varieties (they'll produce scallions, not bulbs, in the Midwest). Planting too late (onions need cool weather for leaf growth before warm weather triggers bulbing). Not curing before storage.

---

## Peas

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 55-70 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow as soon as soil can be worked in spring (4-6 weeks before last frost). Soil temp 40°F+.

Peas are the first reward of the Midwest growing season. Fresh snap peas eaten in the garden, still warm from the sun, are one of life's simple perfections.

**Types:**
- **Snap (sugar snap):** Edible pods with plump peas inside. Best for fresh eating.
- **Snow:** Flat, edible pods, harvested before peas develop. Stir-fry favorite.
- **Shelling:** Pods are tough; you eat only the peas inside. Traditional but more work.

**Spacing:** 2-3 inches apart in double rows 6 inches apart. Provide a trellis for all types over 2 feet tall.

**Support:** Even "bush" peas benefit from support. A section of chicken wire or pea netting between stakes is sufficient.

**Harvest:** Snap peas: when pods are plump and peas are visible through the pod. Snow peas: when pods are full-size but flat. Shelling peas: when pods are full and round. Pick every 1-2 days; unpicked pods signal the plant to stop producing.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Snap:** 'Sugar Snap' (original, 62 days, tall), 'Super Sugar Snap' (improved, disease-resistant), 'Sugar Ann' (56 days, bush, no trellis needed)
- **Snow:** 'Oregon Sugar Pod II' (68 days), 'Mammoth Melting Sugar' (68 days)
- **Shelling:** 'Green Arrow' (68 days), 'Lincoln' (65 days, classic)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting too late. In the Midwest, peas planted after mid-May often hit summer heat before they've finished producing, resulting in poor yields. Plant early and plant fast.

---

## Potatoes

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 70-120 days depending on type
**Plant:** Plant seed potatoes 2-4 weeks before last frost, 4 inches deep. Cut large seed potatoes into pieces with 2-3 eyes each; let cut surfaces dry for 24-48 hours before planting.

Potatoes are satisfying to grow — digging them is like finding buried treasure, and fresh new potatoes are a delicacy that doesn't exist in stores (store-bought "new" potatoes are just small potatoes, not the same thing).

**Types:**
- **Early (70-80 days):** 'Yukon Gold', 'Red Norland', 'Irish Cobbler'
- **Mid-season (80-90 days):** 'Kennebec' (classic baking), 'Gold Rush'
- **Late (90-120 days):** 'Russet Burbank' (the Idaho potato), 'Katahdin'

**Spacing:** 12 inches apart, rows 30-36 inches apart. Plant 4 inches deep and "hill" soil up around stems as plants grow, covering the lower 6-8 inches at each hilling. This gives tubers room to form and protects them from sunlight (which turns them green and toxic).

**Water:** 1-1.5 inches/week, especially during tuber formation (flowering stage). Irregular watering causes knobby, cracked tubers.

**Harvest:** Early potatoes: harvest as "new potatoes" when plants bloom — carefully dig beneath the plant and grab a few. Main crop: harvest 2-3 weeks after tops die back. Dig carefully with a fork to avoid stabbing tubers. Cure in a dark, cool place for 1-2 weeks before storage. Store at 38-45°F in the dark.

**Pest Alert:** Colorado potato beetles are the major pest. Hand-pick adults and larvae, crush orange egg clusters on leaf undersides, and use Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis) or spinosad for heavy infestations.

**Common Mistakes:** Planting grocery store potatoes (may carry disease; use certified seed potatoes). Exposing tubers to light (green potatoes contain solanine, which is toxic). Not hilling. Harvesting too early and not curing before storage.

---

## Radishes

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 22-30 days (spring types), 50-70 days (winter/storage types)
**Plant:** Direct-sow as soon as soil can be worked in spring. Succession-plant every 2 weeks until temps regularly exceed 80°F. Resume in late summer for fall harvest.

Radishes are the instant gratification of the vegetable garden. From seed to plate in 3-4 weeks. They're perfect for impatient gardeners, kids, and marking slow-germinating carrot rows.

**Spacing:** 1-2 inches apart, thin to 2 inches. Rows 6-12 inches apart.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Spring:** 'Cherry Belle' (22 days, classic red round), 'French Breakfast' (25 days, oblong), 'Easter Egg' (25 days, mixed colors)
- **Winter/Storage:** 'Watermelon' (Chinese Red Meat, 60 days, gorgeous inside), 'Daikon' (60 days, Asian), 'Black Spanish Round' (55 days, stores well)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting too thickly (crowded radishes produce leaves, not roots). Growing in summer heat (they bolt instantly). Forgetting winter/storage radish varieties for fall — they're a completely different and underappreciated crop.

---

## Spinach

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 35-50 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow as soon as soil can be worked (4-6 weeks before last frost). Plant again in late August for fall harvest.

Spinach is a cool-weather speedster that bolts at the first sign of warm weather. In the Midwest, you get about a 6-week spring window and a generous fall window. The fall crop is typically better — longer day length in spring triggers bolting, while shortening days in fall delay it.

**Spacing:** 3-4 inches apart, rows 12 inches apart.

**Harvest:** Cut outer leaves for continuous harvest, or cut the whole plant at the base for a one-time harvest. Baby spinach: 3-4 inches tall. Mature: 5-7 inches.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- 'Bloomsdale Long Standing' (48 days, savoy/crinkled, bolt-resistant)
- 'Space' (40 days, smooth-leaf, slow to bolt)
- 'Tyee' (45 days, semi-savoy, excellent disease resistance)
- 'Giant Winter' (45 days, cold-tolerant for fall)

**Common Mistakes:** Planting too late in spring. Not planting for fall (fall spinach is the MVP). Overcrowding. Using warm-season growing techniques (spinach wants cool soil and short days).

---

## Swiss Chard

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** 55-65 days
**Plant:** Direct-sow around last frost date. Tolerates light frost.

Chard is the bridge between cool-season and warm-season: it tolerates spring frost, handles summer heat better than spinach, and keeps producing into fall. It's one of the most productive and beautiful plants in the garden.

**Spacing:** 8-12 inches apart.

**Harvest:** Cut outer stalks when 8-10 inches tall. The center continues producing all season.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- 'Bright Lights' (60 days, multicolored stems, gorgeous)
- 'Fordhook Giant' (60 days, thick white stems, traditional)
- 'Ruby Red/Rhubarb' (59 days, deep red stems)

**Common Mistakes:** Ignoring it. Chard is underrated and one of the easiest, most reliable greens for the Midwest.

---

## Turnips and Rutabagas

**Zones:** All
**Days to Maturity:** Turnips: 35-60 days. Rutabagas: 90-100 days.
**Plant:** Turnips: direct-sow in spring (4 weeks before last frost) and again in late July/August for fall. Rutabagas: direct-sow in June for fall harvest.

Like beets, turnips are a two-for-one crop — roots and greens are both edible and delicious. Rutabagas are turnip's bigger, sweeter, slower-growing cousin — outstanding mashed or roasted, and they store like champions in a root cellar.

**Spacing:** Turnips: 4-6 inches apart. Rutabagas: 6-8 inches apart.

**Best Midwest Varieties:**
- **Turnips:** 'Purple Top White Globe' (classic, 55 days), 'Hakurei' (Japanese salad turnip, 38 days, eat raw!)
- **Rutabagas:** 'American Purple Top' (90 days), 'Laurentian' (90 days)

**Common Mistakes:** Not growing them for fall (they prefer cool weather). Ignoring Hakurei turnips — they're mild, sweet, and nothing like the waxy turnips you're thinking of.

# PART IV: MASTERING THE DETAILS

# Chapter 19: Pests and Diseases of the Midwest Garden

Every garden has pests and diseases. The Midwest, with its humid summers and rich soil, has a particularly enthusiastic selection. The good news: most problems are manageable with knowledge, early detection, and prompt action.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

Before reaching for any spray (organic or conventional), follow the IPM hierarchy:

1. **Prevention.** Healthy soil, proper spacing, crop rotation, resistant varieties, and clean garden practices prevent 80% of problems.
2. **Cultural controls.** Row covers, hand-picking, trap crops, timing plantings to avoid pest cycles.
3. **Biological controls.** Beneficial insects (ladybugs, parasitic wasps, lacewings), Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), and nematodes.
4. **Chemical controls (last resort).** Start with least-toxic options: insecticidal soap, neem oil, pyrethrin. Escalate only if necessary.

## Major Midwest Insect Pests

### Squash Vine Borers
**The pest:** A moth that lays eggs at the base of squash stems in June. Larvae bore into stems, causing sudden wilting and death. Affects zucchini, yellow squash, and pumpkins most; butternut squash is more resistant.

**Prevention:**
- Cover plants with row cover until flowering (remove for pollination or hand-pollinate)
- Wrap stem bases with aluminum foil or nylon stockings
- Plant a second round of squash in late June — borer adults are done laying by mid-July
- Grow resistant varieties: butternut squash, tromboncino squash

**Treatment:** If you see frass (sawdust-like waste) at the stem base, slit the stem lengthwise with a razor blade, extract the larva (white, grub-like, up to 1 inch), and pile moist soil over the wound. The plant may recover.

### Cucumber Beetles (Striped and Spotted)
**The pest:** Small yellow-and-black beetles that feed on cucumbers, melons, and squash. Damage from feeding is manageable — the real danger is bacterial wilt, a fatal disease they transmit while feeding. Once a plant has bacterial wilt, it's dead. There's no cure.

**Prevention:**
- Floating row cover from transplanting until flowering
- Delay planting cucumbers and melons by 1-2 weeks after last frost — peak beetle emergence is in late May
- Yellow sticky traps near plants for monitoring
- Kaolin clay spray (Surround WP) on leaves creates a physical barrier

**Treatment:** Neem oil, pyrethrin, or spinosad for heavy infestations. Hand-pick in early morning when beetles are sluggish.

### Colorado Potato Beetles
**The pest:** Round, striped beetles and their red, hump-backed larvae devour potato and eggplant foliage. Heavy infestations can defoliate plants completely.

**Prevention:**
- Crop rotation (don't plant potatoes or eggplant in the same spot two years running)
- Floating row cover over potatoes (they don't need pollination)
- Straw mulch (makes it harder for beetles to find plants)

**Treatment:** Hand-pick adults and larvae into soapy water. Crush bright orange egg masses on leaf undersides. Bt var. tenebrionis (sold as 'Colorado Potato Beetle Killer') works on larvae. Spinosad is effective on all life stages.

### Tomato Hornworms
**The pest:** Enormous (3-4 inch) green caterpillars that strip tomato, pepper, and eggplant plants seemingly overnight. Hard to spot despite their size — they blend in perfectly.

**Treatment:** Hand-pick. That's usually sufficient — even 2-3 hornworms on a plant cause dramatic damage, and removing them stops it immediately. If you find a hornworm covered in small white cocoons, leave it — those are braconid wasp pupae that will kill the hornworm and produce more beneficial wasps.

### Japanese Beetles
**The pest:** Metallic green-and-copper beetles that skeletonize leaves on beans, grapes, roses, and many other plants. June-July peak.

**Treatment:** Hand-pick into soapy water in early morning. Neem oil deters feeding. Milky spore or beneficial nematodes applied to lawns kill larvae (white grubs) in the soil. Avoid beetle traps — they attract far more beetles to your yard than they catch.

### Cabbage Worms and Cabbage Loopers
**The pest:** Green caterpillars that chew holes in brassica leaves (broccoli, cabbage, kale, cauliflower). Imported cabbage white butterflies (those little white butterflies fluttering around your garden) are laying eggs on your plants.

**Prevention:** Floating row cover from transplanting through harvest (brassicas don't need pollination). This is 100% effective.

**Treatment:** Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki) spray — completely safe for humans and beneficial insects, lethal to caterpillars. Apply every 7-10 days, especially after rain.

### Aphids
**The pest:** Tiny soft-bodied insects that cluster on new growth and leaf undersides, sucking sap and excreting sticky honeydew. Present on almost everything but rarely fatal.

**Treatment:** Strong blast of water from a hose knocks them off. Ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps eat them by the hundreds. Insecticidal soap for severe infestations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides — they kill the beneficial insects that naturally control aphids.

### Flea Beetles
**The pest:** Tiny black beetles that riddle leaves with small round holes (shot-hole damage). Worst on eggplant, young brassicas, and radishes in spring.

**Prevention:** Floating row cover. Delaying planting slightly — flea beetles are most active in cool spring weather and decline as summer progresses.

**Treatment:** Kaolin clay spray. Neem oil. Spinosad for severe infestations.

## Major Midwest Plant Diseases

### Early Blight (Tomatoes)
**Symptoms:** Brown spots with concentric rings ("target spots") on lower leaves, spreading upward. Nearly inevitable in the humid Midwest.

**Prevention:** Resistant varieties, mulch (prevents soil splash), lower-leaf pruning, adequate spacing for air circulation, drip irrigation (not overhead).

**Treatment:** Remove and destroy affected leaves. Copper fungicide or chlorothalonil (Daconil) applied preventively every 7-10 days in wet weather. Rotate tomatoes — don't plant in the same spot for 3-4 years.

### Late Blight (Tomatoes and Potatoes)
**Symptoms:** Large, dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems. Can destroy a plant in days. The disease that caused the Irish Potato Famine.

**Prevention:** Resistant varieties ('Defiant PhR', 'Iron Lady', 'Mountain Magic'). Don't plant near potatoes. Watch weather — late blight thrives in cool, wet conditions (60-70°F with rain or fog).

**Treatment:** If caught very early, copper fungicide may slow it. More often, infected plants should be removed and destroyed (do NOT compost) to prevent spread to neighboring gardens. Late blight spores travel on wind for miles.

### Powdery Mildew (Squash, Cucumbers)
**Symptoms:** White powdery coating on upper leaf surfaces. Reduces photosynthesis and weakens plants but rarely kills them outright.

**Prevention:** Resistant varieties, spacing for air circulation, avoiding overhead watering.

**Treatment:** Potassium bicarbonate spray (1 tablespoon per gallon of water plus a few drops of liquid soap). Neem oil. Sulfur spray (don't use sulfur within 2 weeks of any oil-based spray).

### Septoria Leaf Spot (Tomatoes)
**Symptoms:** Numerous small spots with gray centers and dark borders on lower leaves. Similar management to early blight.

### Bacterial Wilt (Cucumbers, Melons)
**Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of entire vines, starting with individual leaves and progressing to the whole plant within days. Transmitted by cucumber beetles.

**Diagnosis:** Cut a wilted stem and squeeze — if a sticky, string-like bacterial ooze stretches from the cut surface, it's bacterial wilt.

**Treatment:** None. Remove and destroy infected plants. Prevent by controlling cucumber beetles with row cover.

### Clubroot (Brassicas)
**Symptoms:** Stunted, wilting plants with swollen, distorted roots. A soil-borne disease that persists for years.

**Prevention:** Maintain soil pH above 7.0 in brassica beds (add lime). Rotate brassicas on a 7-year cycle in infected soil. Don't transplant from unknown sources.

## Common Mistakes

- **Spraying before identifying the problem.** Know what you're fighting before you fight it. Spraying fungicide on an insect pest wastes money and time.
- **Using broad-spectrum pesticides.** These kill beneficial insects along with pests, creating a worse problem long-term. Targeted, specific treatments are always better.
- **Skipping prevention.** Row cover, crop rotation, resistant varieties, and good sanitation prevent 80%+ of pest and disease problems. They're boring. They work.
- **Ignoring early signs.** A few aphids, a single yellow leaf, three cucumber beetles — these are warning flags. Deal with them now, not when the problem explodes.

# Chapter 20: Companion Planting for the Midwest Garden

Companion planting is the practice of growing certain plants together for mutual benefit — pest deterrence, improved pollination, enhanced growth, or better use of space. Some companion planting lore is backed by solid research; some is garden mythology passed down through generations. We'll focus on what actually works.

## Proven Companions

| Companion Pair | Benefit |
|---------------|---------|
| Tomatoes + Basil | Basil may repel aphids and whiteflies; improves tomato flavor (debated, but they share water/fertility needs so they grow well together regardless) |
| Corn + Beans + Squash ("Three Sisters") | Classic Native American polyculture. Corn provides a trellis for beans. Beans fix nitrogen for corn. Squash shades the ground, suppressing weeds and retaining moisture. Works beautifully in the Midwest. |
| Carrots + Onions | Onion scent confuses carrot rust fly; carrot scent may repel onion fly |
| Brassicas + Dill/Cilantro | Flowering dill and cilantro attract parasitic wasps that prey on cabbage worms |
| Lettuce + Tall crops (corn, tomatoes) | Tall crops provide shade that prevents lettuce from bolting in summer heat |
| Beans + Potatoes | Beans fix nitrogen that benefits potatoes; potatoes may repel Mexican bean beetles |
| Marigolds + Everything | French marigolds (Tagetes patula) suppress root-knot nematodes in the soil. Their scent may deter some above-ground pests. Plant them as a border around vegetable beds. |
| Nasturtiums + Brassicas/Squash | Nasturtiums act as a trap crop for aphids — aphids prefer nasturtiums over vegetables, concentrating pests on a sacrificial plant. |

## The Three Sisters in the Midwest

The Three Sisters planting deserves special mention because it's ideally suited to Midwest conditions and Midwest history. Native peoples of the Great Lakes and Great Plains regions developed this system over centuries.

**How to plant:**
1. Build a mound of enriched soil 18 inches across, 6 inches high
2. Plant 4-5 corn seeds in the center of the mound
3. When corn is 6 inches tall, plant 4 bean seeds (pole type) around the corn in a circle
4. At the same time, plant 2 squash seeds at the base of the mound

**Spacing:** Mounds 5-6 feet apart in all directions.

**What to expect:** The corn grows tall and provides a living trellis for beans. Beans climb the corn and fix nitrogen. Squash vines spread between mounds, shading the soil. It's not as space-efficient as intensive beds, but it's productive, sustainable, and beautiful.

## What to Avoid Planting Together

| Bad Combination | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| Tomatoes + Fennel | Fennel inhibits most nearby plants |
| Beans + Alliums (onions, garlic) | Alliums may inhibit bean growth |
| Dill + Carrots (when dill flowers) | Can cross-pollinate, affecting carrot seed quality |
| Potatoes + Tomatoes | Share diseases (late blight); keep them apart in the rotation |
| Brassicas + Strawberries | Both attract the same pests; strawberries may stunt brassica growth |

## Planting for Pollinators

Midwest vegetable gardens depend on pollination for fruiting crops. Attract pollinators by:

- **Planting flowers in and around the garden:** Zinnias, sunflowers, cosmos, borage, phacelia, and sweet alyssum
- **Providing a water source:** A shallow dish with pebbles and water
- **Avoiding pesticides during bloom:** Even organic pesticides (pyrethrin, spinosad) can kill bees. Spray only in evening when bees are inactive.
- **Leaving some ground bare:** Native ground-nesting bees (which are excellent pollinators) need bare soil to nest in. Don't mulch every square inch.

> **Pro Tip:** Plant a row of sunflowers along the north edge of your garden. They attract pollinators, provide a windbreak, are gorgeous, and produce seeds you can eat or feed to birds in winter. In the Midwest, sunflowers are practically a cultural requirement.

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating companion planting as magic.** It's a useful tool, not a replacement for good soil, water, and pest management. A marigold border won't save a poorly maintained garden.
- **Spacing companions too closely.** The companion benefit isn't worth it if plants are competing for light, water, and nutrients. Maintain proper spacing.
- **Ignoring what actually works.** Row cover is a better pest barrier than any companion plant. Use companions as a supplement, not a substitute for proven practices.

# Chapter 21: Season Extension — Getting More from Your Midwest Garden

The Midwest growing season is the biggest constraint you face. In Zone 3, you might have 100 frost-free days. In Zone 5, maybe 160. But with season extension techniques, you can garden productively from March through December — and in some cases, year-round.

## Cold Frames

A cold frame is a bottomless box with a transparent lid, placed over garden soil. Sunlight heats the interior; the insulated walls and lid trap warmth.

**Construction:** A simple cold frame is a wooden frame (2x12 lumber, 4x4 feet) with an old window sash on top, hinged at the back. The back should be 4-6 inches taller than the front to angle the lid toward the sun.

**Use:**
- Start growing 4-6 weeks earlier in spring
- Harden off seedlings
- Grow lettuce, spinach, radishes, and Asian greens through November and into December
- Overwinter hardy greens (kale, mâche, claytonia) for winter harvest in Zone 5-6

**Management:** Vent (prop open the lid) on sunny days above 40°F to prevent overheating. Interior temps can soar past 90°F on a sunny March day. Close the lid by mid-afternoon to trap heat for the night. On bitter-cold nights, drape the lid with a blanket or old carpet for extra insulation.

## Low Tunnels and Row Cover

**Floating row cover** (spunbonded polypropylene) draped directly over crops provides 2-8°F of frost protection depending on weight:

| Weight | Frost Protection | Light Transmission | Best Use |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Lightweight (0.5 oz/sq yd) | 2-4°F | 90% | Insect barrier, light frost |
| Medium (1.0 oz/sq yd) | 4-6°F | 85% | Spring/fall frost protection |
| Heavy (1.5 oz/sq yd) | 6-8°F | 70% | Winter growing, hard frost |

**Low tunnels** are hoops of bent wire or conduit covered with plastic or heavy row cover. They create a mini greenhouse over a bed.

Materials: 10-foot lengths of 1/2-inch EMT conduit or #9 wire, bent into hoops. Space every 4-5 feet along the bed. Cover with 6-mil greenhouse plastic (for maximum warmth) or heavy row cover (for breathability and less overheating risk). Secure edges with sandbags, bricks, or soil.

**Effectiveness:** A low tunnel over a Midwest garden bed extends the season by 4-6 weeks on each end, potentially adding 8-12 weeks to your total growing season. In Zone 5, that's the difference between 160 frost-free days and 220+ growing days.

## High Tunnels (Hoop Houses)

A high tunnel is a walk-in structure — essentially an unheated greenhouse. Typically 12-30 feet wide, 50-100+ feet long, with a steel or PVC frame covered in greenhouse poly.

**Cost:** $1-3 per square foot for DIY; $5-10 per square foot for commercial kits. USDA NRCS EQIP program offers cost-share funding for high tunnels in many Midwest states — check with your local office.

**What they provide:**
- 15-25°F warmer than outside on sunny days
- Season extension of 6-10 weeks on each end
- Rain protection (critical for disease management on tomatoes)
- Wind protection
- Year-round growing in Zone 5-6 (with supplemental heat or cold-hardy crops only)

A high tunnel in the Midwest transforms your gardening capability. Tomatoes grown in high tunnels produce 2-4 weeks earlier, yield 2-3 times more, and have dramatically fewer disease problems (no rain splash = no blight).

## Black Plastic Mulch

Laying black plastic over prepared beds 2-3 weeks before transplanting warms soil by 5-10°F. Combined with transplanting through slits in the plastic, this effectively moves your garden one full zone warmer. Essential for melons, eggplant, peppers, and sweet potatoes in Zones 3-5.

**Application:** Lay the plastic tightly against the soil surface, securing edges with soil or landscape staples. Cut X-shaped slits for transplants. Install drip irrigation beneath the plastic before laying it (you can't water through plastic).

## Wall O' Water and Similar Products

These water-filled plastic cylinders surround individual plants and create a warm microenvironment using the thermal mass of water. They protect to 16°F — that's Zone 3 cold. Place them over tomato and pepper transplants 2-4 weeks before last frost for the earliest harvests in the neighborhood.

**Cost:** $3-5 each. Reusable for several seasons.

## Straw Bale Gardens

Straw bales can serve as both growing medium and insulation. Condition bales for 2-3 weeks (alternating nitrogen fertilizer and water to begin decomposition), then plant directly into them. The decomposing straw generates heat from the interior, warming root zones by 10-15°F above ambient soil temp. This is particularly useful in Zone 3-4 where cold soil is the primary limiting factor.

## Winter Growing (Yes, Really)

With the right setup, Midwest gardeners can harvest fresh greens through winter:

**What grows in winter (Zone 5-6 in a cold frame or low tunnel):**
- Spinach (barely grows but stays alive; harvest existing leaves)
- Mâche (corn salad) — extremely cold-hardy
- Claytonia (miner's lettuce)
- Kale (harvest existing leaves)
- Green onions
- Parsley

**The key principle:** You're not growing new plants in winter — you're maintaining plants that you started in September and October, harvesting leaves that grew in fall. The cold frame or tunnel keeps them alive and slowly growing; you harvest, and they slowly regrow.

Eliot Coleman's "Four Season Harvest" techniques, developed in Maine (similar climate to Zone 4), work beautifully in the Midwest. Plant cold-hardy greens in September, protect with low tunnels or cold frames, and harvest fresh salad through January and February.

> **Pro Tip:** In a cold frame or low tunnel, soil temperature matters more than air temperature. As long as soil stays above 28-30°F (which it will under protection in most of the Midwest, most of the winter), cold-hardy greens survive. They won't grow much when days are shorter than 10 hours (November through February), but they'll persist, and you can harvest what's there.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not venting cold frames on sunny days.** Interior temps can hit 100°F+ in March sun. Plants cook. Automated vent openers ($30-40) are a worthwhile investment.
- **Starting winter gardens too late.** Plants must be established before day length drops below 10 hours (mid-November in most of the Midwest). Sow winter greens by mid-September.
- **Over-relying on plastic.** Unvented plastic covers create condensation that promotes disease. Use row cover for breathability, or vent plastic tunnels daily.
- **Expecting summer production.** Season extension gives you salad greens and cold-hardy roots in winter — not tomatoes. Adjust expectations and appreciate what's possible.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not using your cooperative extension.** Free, local, research-based advice from people who garden in your climate. There's no reason not to use them.
- **Relying solely on internet advice.** A YouTube video from California is not relevant to your Zone 4 garden. Seek Midwest-specific sources.
- **Not connecting with local gardeners.** Garden clubs, master gardener groups, community gardens, and local Facebook groups connect you with people who know your specific area. Their experience is invaluable.

# Acknowledgments

This book was written for everyone who has ever stood in a frozen Midwest backyard in March, staring at the dormant garden, and thought: "Soon."

The Midwest is not the easiest place to garden. But it might be the most rewarding. You work within constraints — frost dates, short seasons, dramatic weather — and those constraints make you a better, more creative, more resourceful gardener. The harvests you wring from this land taste better because you earned them.

The soil beneath your feet is extraordinary. The growing traditions of this region — from the Three Sisters polycultures of indigenous peoples to the truck farms of European immigrants to the victory gardens of wartime to the community gardens and urban farms of today — represent centuries of accumulated knowledge and love for growing food.

You are part of that tradition now. Every tomato you grow, every row of beans you plant, every October garlic clove you press into cold soil with the faith that it will emerge in spring — you're continuing something that matters.

Go grow something.
