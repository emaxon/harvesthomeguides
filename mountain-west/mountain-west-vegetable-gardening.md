# Part I: Getting Started in the Mountain West

# Chapter 1: Why the Mountain West Is Different

You want to grow vegetables at altitude. Maybe you're in a Denver suburb at 5,280 feet, maybe you're in a Montana valley at 4,200 feet, or maybe you're genuinely crazy and trying to garden at 8,500 feet outside Leadville, Colorado. Wherever you are in this region, you've probably already discovered that the gardening advice written for sea-level America doesn't work here.

That's because the Mountain West breaks the rules. Your growing season might be 80 days or 160 days depending on which side of a ridge you live on. The sun is so intense it can sunscald a tomato in July, then a frost can kill that same tomato in August. Your soil is alkaline, your air is thin, your water might be legally spoken for, and an elk can eat your entire garden in one midnight visit.

This book is for you. Not generic cold-climate advice with a mountain photo on the cover — actual, specific guidance for growing food in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The five states where altitude, aridity, and short seasons combine to create one of the most challenging — and most rewarding — gardening environments in the country.

## Five States, One Identity, Endless Variation

The Mountain West shares a core identity: high elevation, low humidity, intense UV, alkaline soils, dramatic temperature swings, and short growing seasons. But within that identity, the variation is enormous. Let's meet the regions.

### Colorado's Front Range (Zones 5a–6b)

**Elevation:** 5,000–6,500 feet  
**Last spring frost:** April 25–May 15  
**First fall frost:** September 25–October 15  
**Frost-free days:** 135–165

The Front Range — Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs — is where most Colorado gardeners live, and it's the most forgiving part of this region. You get a decent growing season, access to excellent nurseries and extension resources, and enough warmth to grow tomatoes, peppers, and even melons in a good year. The catches: hail (Denver averages 7–9 hail days per year), alkaline clay soil, 300+ days of sunshine that sounds great until your lettuce bolts in June, and afternoon thunderstorms that arrive like clockwork in July.

### Colorado Mountain Towns (Zones 3b–5a)

**Elevation:** 7,000–10,000+ feet  
**Last spring frost:** May 15–June 15  
**First fall frost:** August 25–September 25  
**Frost-free days:** 60–120

This is extreme gardening. At 9,000 feet, your season might be 75 days. You're dealing with UV intensity 25–40% higher than sea level, nighttime temperatures that can drop to the 30s in July, and soil that thaws in May only to reveal rocky, thin, acidic substrate (one of the few places in this region where soil trends acidic). Root crops, greens, and cold-hardy brassicas are your bread and butter. Tomatoes are possible — with season extension, the right varieties, and a little prayer.

### Utah's Wasatch Front (Zones 6a–7a)

**Elevation:** 4,200–5,000 feet  
**Last spring frost:** April 10–May 1  
**First fall frost:** October 5–25  
**Frost-free days:** 155–185

Salt Lake City, Provo, and Ogden sit in the warm pocket of the Wasatch Front, and this is genuinely one of the best gardening zones in the Mountain West. The Great Salt Lake moderates temperatures slightly, you get a longer season than most of the region, and the valley floor warms up nicely. Challenges: some of the most alkaline soil in the country (pH 7.8–8.5 is common), salinity issues in some areas, and the inversion layer that traps cold air in winter valleys.

### Utah's Southern Corridor (Zones 7a–8a)

**Elevation:** 2,800–4,500 feet  
**Last spring frost:** March 20–April 15  
**First fall frost:** October 15–November 5  
**Frost-free days:** 180–220

St. George and Cedar City push into conditions more like the desert Southwest. Long seasons, intense heat, low water — if you're here, you're essentially desert gardening with some mountain influence. We'll cover your specific needs, but much of this book focuses on the higher, colder zones that define the core Mountain West experience.

### Idaho's Treasure Valley (Zones 6a–7a)

**Elevation:** 2,600–3,200 feet  
**Last spring frost:** April 15–May 1  
**First fall frost:** October 5–20  
**Frost-free days:** 155–180

Boise and the surrounding Treasure Valley is an agricultural powerhouse for a reason. Rich volcanic soil, access to Snake River irrigation, and a surprisingly generous season make this one of the easiest places to garden in the Mountain West. Idaho grows more potatoes than anywhere in the country — but your backyard can grow far more than spuds. The volcanic loam here is lower in pH than most of the region (6.5–7.5), which is a gift.

### Idaho's Panhandle and Eastern Highlands (Zones 4a–6a)

**Elevation:** 1,500–6,000 feet  
**Last spring frost:** April 25–May 25  
**First fall frost:** September 15–October 10  
**Frost-free days:** 110–155

Northern Idaho around Coeur d'Alene gets more moisture than the rest of the Mountain West (25+ inches annually), with forested, slightly acidic soils. Eastern Idaho — Idaho Falls, Pocatello — is higher, drier, and colder, with a tighter season more like Montana.

### Montana (Zones 3a–5b)

**Elevation:** 3,000–6,000 feet  
**Last spring frost:** May 1–June 5  
**First fall frost:** September 5–October 5  
**Frost-free days:** 90–140

Montana is big and brutal. The western valleys (Missoula, Helena, Bozeman) are milder, with seasons approaching 130–140 days. Eastern Montana is windswept prairie with 90–110 frost-free days and temperature swings that would make a weathervane dizzy — it can be 95°F in July and -40°F in January. The chinook winds on the eastern slopes can spike temperatures 40 degrees in a few hours, which sounds helpful until you realize they also dry out every bit of moisture in your soil.

### Wyoming (Zones 3a–5a)

**Elevation:** 3,500–8,000 feet  
**Last spring frost:** May 5–June 10  
**First fall frost:** September 1–October 1  
**Frost-free days:** 80–130

Wyoming is the Mountain West on hard mode. The wind alone — average 12–15 mph statewide, with gusts regularly exceeding 50 mph — makes gardening an engineering challenge. Cheyenne, Laramie, and Casper all sit above 5,000 feet with short, intense seasons. Sheltered spots in the Bighorn Basin (Cody, Thermopolis) and the area around Sheridan offer relatively gentler conditions, but "gentle" is a relative term in Wyoming.

## The Altitude Factor

Here's what altitude does to gardening, and why it matters more than your USDA zone number:

**UV intensity increases ~7% per 1,000 feet of elevation.** At 5,000 feet, you're getting 35% more UV than a sea-level garden. At 8,000 feet, it's 55% more. This means more intense photosynthesis (which is good — plants grow fast), but also more sunscald, faster soil moisture evaporation, and leaf burn on tender transplants.

**Air pressure drops.** Water boils at 202°F in Denver instead of 212°F. More relevantly for gardens, lower air pressure means water evaporates faster from soil and leaves. Your plants are thirstier than the same varieties at sea level.

**Temperature swings are dramatic.** A 40-degree difference between daytime high and nighttime low is routine. This is actually great for tomatoes and peppers (which need cool nights to set fruit), but it also means a beautiful 80°F afternoon can become a 38°F night that stresses warm-season crops.

**The atmosphere is thinner.** Less atmosphere means less insulation. Heat radiates away faster at night — which is why frost can hit even when daytime temperatures are warm. Clear, calm nights at altitude are frost machines.

## Average Frost Dates by Sub-Region

| Sub-Region | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Frost-Free Days |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| CO Front Range | Apr 25–May 15 | Sep 25–Oct 15 | 135–165 |
| CO Mountain Towns | May 15–Jun 15 | Aug 25–Sep 25 | 60–120 |
| UT Wasatch Front | Apr 10–May 1 | Oct 5–25 | 155–185 |
| UT Southern Corridor | Mar 20–Apr 15 | Oct 15–Nov 5 | 180–220 |
| ID Treasure Valley | Apr 15–May 1 | Oct 5–20 | 155–180 |
| ID Panhandle/East | Apr 25–May 25 | Sep 15–Oct 10 | 110–155 |
| MT Western Valleys | May 1–25 | Sep 15–Oct 5 | 115–140 |
| MT Eastern Prairie | May 15–Jun 5 | Sep 5–25 | 90–120 |
| WY Sheltered Basins | May 5–25 | Sep 15–Oct 1 | 110–130 |
| WY High Plains | May 15–Jun 10 | Sep 1–20 | 80–110 |

> **Pro Tip:** Your county Extension office is your single best local resource. Colorado State, Utah State, University of Idaho, Montana State, and the University of Wyoming all run Extension programs that publish frost date data specific to your area — and it's all free. Google "[your county] Extension office" and bookmark it.

## One Season — Make It Count

Unlike Texas or the Southeast, you don't get two growing seasons. You get one. One sprint from last frost to first frost, and in some locations, that sprint is more like a 100-meter dash than a marathon.

This reality shapes everything in this book:
- **Start early indoors.** Many crops need 6–10 weeks of indoor growth before transplanting.
- **Season extension isn't optional.** Row covers, cold frames, and hoop houses can add 4–8 weeks to your season.
- **Variety selection is critical.** A 90-day tomato is useless if you have 80 frost-free days. You need short-season varieties bred for your reality.
- **Succession planting is compressed.** You might get two rounds of lettuce instead of four, so plan tightly.

We'll cover all of this in detail. For now, know this: Mountain West gardening rewards planning, punishes procrastination, and produces some of the most intensely flavored vegetables you'll ever eat. That thin air and intense sun? It concentrates sugars and flavors in ways that lowland gardens can't match. A tomato grown at 5,000 feet tastes different — better — than one grown at sea level. That's not poetry. That's photochemistry.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trusting the USDA zone alone.** Zone tells you minimum winter temperature. It says nothing about season length, altitude, UV, or wind — the factors that actually define Mountain West gardening.
- **Planting too early.** That warm April day is a trap. Soil temperature matters more than air temperature, and your soil is still cold.
- **Ignoring microclimates.** The south side of your house might be Zone 6. The north side might be Zone 4. The low spot in your yard is a frost pocket. Learn your property.
- **Choosing the wrong varieties.** "Days to maturity" on a seed packet is based on optimal conditions at sea level. Add 10–15% at altitude. A "75-day" tomato might take 85 days at 6,000 feet.
- **Underestimating wildlife.** Deer, elk, rabbits, voles, and ground squirrels consider your garden a salad bar. Fencing isn't optional in most of this region.

# Chapter 2: Understanding Mountain West Soil

If you dig a hole anywhere in the Mountain West, you'll likely find one of three things: alkaline clay, rocky hardpan, or decomposed granite that drains faster than you can water it. Occasionally you'll hit genuine loam — usually in Idaho's volcanic valleys or Montana's river bottoms — and when you do, you should whisper a quiet thank you to whatever geological forces created it.

Most of us aren't that lucky.

## Soil Types Across the Region

### Alkaline Clay (Front Range CO, Wasatch Front UT, parts of WY and MT)

The dominant soil type along Colorado's Front Range and Utah's Wasatch corridor is alkaline clay with a pH typically between 7.5 and 8.5. This stuff is dense, sticky when wet, hard as concrete when dry, and stubbornly resistant to change. It holds nutrients well (too well — it locks up iron, zinc, and manganese at high pH), and it holds water like a bathtub until it finally saturates, at which point it becomes an anaerobic swamp.

**What to do about it:** Amend with 4–6 inches of compost worked into the top 8–10 inches annually. Don't bother trying to "fix" the pH with sulfur unless you're prepared to reapply every year — the underlying calcium carbonate will buffer it right back. Instead, add chelated iron and zinc as foliar sprays when you see chlorosis (yellowing between green veins). Gypsum (40 lbs per 1,000 sq ft) can improve clay structure without changing pH. Raised beds filled with quality soil mix are the most reliable solution.

### Rocky Mountain Soil (Mountain towns throughout the region)

Above 7,000 feet, soil is often thin — sometimes just a few inches over bedrock or decomposed granite. It's rocky, low in organic matter, and drains fast. Ironically, mountain soils tend to be more acidic (pH 5.5–7.0) than valley floors because there's less calcium carbonate and more decomposing conifer needles.

**What to do about it:** Build up, not down. Raised beds or bermed rows filled with imported soil are standard practice in mountain towns. If you're gardening in-ground, add massive amounts of compost — 6+ inches worked in — and accept that you're essentially creating soil from scratch. Rock removal is an ongoing hobby. You'll never finish.

### Volcanic Loam (Southern Idaho, parts of Eastern Oregon spillover)

Idaho's Treasure Valley and Snake River Plain sit on volcanic soil that is genuinely excellent for gardening. Dark, fertile, well-draining loam with a pH of 6.5–7.5. This is why Idaho is an agricultural powerhouse — the soil does half the work for you.

**What to do about it:** Don't mess it up. Add compost annually (2–3 inches) to maintain organic matter. This soil's only real weakness is that it can compact under heavy foot traffic and machinery, so use permanent beds and paths.

### Prairie Soil (Eastern MT, Eastern WY, parts of northern CO)

The high plains east of the Rockies have deep, fertile soil — often classified as mollisols (grassland soils) — that's excellent for growing if you can deal with the wind, the temperature extremes, and the limited water. pH runs 7.0–8.0.

**What to do about it:** Wind protection is more important than soil amendment here. The soil itself is often quite good once you add organic matter and establish windbreaks. Dryland farming techniques — deep mulching, moisture conservation, wide spacing — are worth studying.

### Saline and Sodic Soils (Parts of UT, WY, and CO)

Some areas in the Mountain West — particularly in Utah's valleys and parts of Wyoming — have soils with elevated salt levels. White crusting on the soil surface is the telltale sign. Saline soils (electrical conductivity above 4 dS/m) can stunt or kill vegetables, and sodic soils (high sodium) destroy soil structure entirely.

**What to do about it:** Test first. If your soil EC is above 4 dS/m, you need to leach salts by applying excess water and ensuring good drainage — which is difficult in clay. Raised beds with fresh soil are the practical solution. Gypsum can help displace sodium in sodic soils. Avoid manure from animals fed high-salt diets (common in feedlot areas).

## Getting Your Soil Tested

A soil test is not optional in the Mountain West. Your state's Extension lab is the best and cheapest option:

| State | Lab | Cost | Website |
|-------|-----|------|---------|
| Colorado | CSU Soil Testing Lab | ~$35 | soiltestinglab.colostate.edu |
| Utah | USU Analytical Lab | ~$30 | usual.usu.edu |
| Idaho | U of I Analytical Sciences Lab | ~$30 | uidaho.edu/cals/analytical-sciences |
| Montana | MSU Soil Testing Lab | ~$30 | landresources.montana.edu |
| Wyoming | UW Soil Testing Lab | ~$30 | uwyo.edu/uwexpstn |

Test for: pH, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and salinity (EC). In areas with known issues, add tests for iron, zinc, manganese, and sodium.

> **Pro Tip:** Test your soil every 2–3 years. Conditions change, especially when you're amending heavily. A $30 test can save you $200 in wrong amendments.

## The Compost Question

Compost is the universal answer in Mountain West soils. It improves clay structure, adds organic matter to sandy and rocky soils, feeds soil biology, and moderately buffers pH. But not all compost is equal.

**Municipal compost** (often available free or cheap from your city): Variable quality. Can contain weed seeds, pesticide residues, and high salt levels. Test it or ask for a recent analysis before buying in bulk.

**Composted manure:** Excellent if well-aged (6+ months). Fresh manure burns plants and can contain viable weed seeds. Horse manure from animals fed hay treated with aminopyralid or clopyralid herbicides is a particular hazard — these herbicides survive composting and will destroy broadleaf vegetables. Ask your manure source about herbicide-treated hay.

**Homemade compost:** The gold standard, but hard to make in quantity in the Mountain West. Low humidity slows decomposition. Keep piles moist and consider enclosed tumblers to maintain heat and moisture.

**Bagged compost:** Consistent but expensive at scale. Fine for containers and small beds. Not practical for amending large in-ground areas.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trying to fix pH with one-time sulfur applications.** In alkaline, calcium-rich soils, pH correction is a multi-year battle. Address nutrient lockout with chelated micronutrients instead.
- **Adding sand to clay.** This creates something very close to concrete. Add organic matter, not sand.
- **Skipping the soil test.** You can't fix what you haven't measured. Spend the $30.
- **Using uncomposted manure.** It burns roots, introduces weed seeds, and in the Mountain West's dry conditions, takes forever to break down.
- **Ignoring salinity.** Especially in Utah and Wyoming, salt buildup is a real problem. Test for EC if you see white crusting or unexplained plant stress.

# Chapter 3: Water in the Mountain West

Water is the defining resource constraint of Mountain West gardening. This isn't the humid Southeast where rain handles half your irrigation needs. Annual precipitation ranges from 8 inches in parts of Wyoming and Utah to maybe 20 inches in Montana's western valleys — and most of that falls as winter snow, not summer rain.

But water in the Mountain West isn't just a scarcity problem. It's a legal problem.

## Water Rights: The Basics You Need to Know

If you're new to the region, this might surprise you: in all five Mountain West states, water is governed by the Prior Appropriation Doctrine. This means water belongs to whoever claimed it first, not to whoever owns the land it flows through. "First in time, first in right."

**What this means for your garden:**

- **Municipal water:** If you're on city water, you're fine. Your water utility holds the rights. Use what comes out of your tap (and pay for it).
- **Well water:** Your well permit specifies what you can use the water for. In Colorado, many residential wells are limited to indoor use and the irrigation of up to one acre of lawn and garden. Check your well permit.
- **Rainwater collection:** This varies by state. Colorado legalized residential rain barrel collection in 2016 (up to 110 gallons, two barrels). Utah allows up to 2,500 gallons with registration. Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming generally allow rainwater collection for residential use, but check current regulations.
- **Ditch water/irrigation shares:** Some properties come with irrigation water rights (shares in a ditch company or irrigation district). This is often the cheapest water available — but it runs on the ditch schedule, not yours, and the season may end before your garden does.

> **Pro Tip:** In Colorado, check your well permit at the Division of Water Resources (dwr.colorado.gov) before relying on well water for garden irrigation. Illegal water use — even for a backyard garden — can result in fines.

## How Much Water Your Garden Actually Needs

The standard advice is "1 inch per week." In the Mountain West, that's a starting point, not an answer.

At altitude, water demand increases because:
- **Lower humidity** accelerates evapotranspiration
- **Intense UV** heats soil surfaces faster
- **Thin air** means less atmospheric moisture
- **Wind** strips moisture from leaves and soil

A realistic estimate for Mountain West vegetable gardens:

| Condition | Weekly Water Need |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Valley floor, mulched beds, moderate wind | 1–1.5 inches |
| Elevated sites, exposed, windy | 1.5–2 inches |
| Mountain towns, above 7,000 ft | 1.5–2 inches |
| Sandy or rocky soil | 2+ inches (split into multiple applications) |
| Clay soil | 1–1.5 inches (applied slowly to prevent runoff) |

## Irrigation Methods Ranked for the Mountain West

**1. Drip irrigation (best option).** Delivers water directly to root zones. Minimizes evaporation loss. Works beautifully with mulch. Easy to automate with a timer. In arid conditions, drip irrigation can be 90% efficient vs. 50–60% for overhead sprinklers. Cost: $50–150 to set up a basic system for a home garden.

**2. Soaker hoses.** Budget version of drip irrigation. Less precise but still better than overhead watering. Lay them under mulch. Replace every 2–3 seasons as they clog and degrade.

**3. Hand watering.** Fine for containers and small beds. Impractical for larger gardens. You'll inevitably underwater because standing with a hose gets boring.

**4. Overhead sprinklers (avoid for vegetables).** Wastes water to evaporation (especially in our low humidity and wind), promotes fungal disease on leaves, and can knock over young plants. Use sprinklers for lawns. Use drip for vegetables.

## Mulch: Your Best Water-Saving Tool

Mulch reduces watering needs by 25–50% — no exaggeration. In the Mountain West, mulch isn't decorative. It's infrastructure.

**Straw** (not hay — hay has seeds): 3–4 inches around plants after soil has warmed. The single most popular mulch for Mountain West vegetable gardens. Inexpensive, readily available, and effective.

**Wood chips:** Better for paths than beds. Can tie up nitrogen as they decompose if mixed into soil. Keep them on the surface.

**Black plastic or landscape fabric:** Warms soil (useful early in season), suppresses weeds, and reduces evaporation. Use with drip irrigation underneath. Remove or replace annually.

**Grass clippings:** Free and effective but apply in thin layers (1–2 inches) to prevent matting. Make sure the lawn wasn't treated with herbicides.

> **Pro Tip:** Don't mulch too early in spring. Mulch insulates — it keeps soil cool when you want it warming up. Wait until soil temperatures reach 60°F (usually 2–3 weeks after transplanting warm-season crops) before applying summer mulch.

## Watering Schedules That Actually Work

**Morning watering is best.** Water between 5:00 and 9:00 AM. This gives plants moisture before the heat of the day and allows foliage to dry before evening (reducing disease risk). Evening watering is second best. Midday watering wastes water to evaporation.

**Frequency depends on soil type:**
- **Clay soil:** Water deeply (run your drip system for 45–60 minutes) 2–3 times per week. Clay holds water, so deep infrequent watering is better than daily shallow watering.
- **Sandy/rocky soil:** Water more frequently (4–5 times per week) for shorter durations. Water passes through fast, so you need to replenish more often.
- **Raised beds:** Dry out faster than in-ground gardens. Check daily during hot weather. Water when the top 2 inches of soil are dry.
- **Containers:** May need daily watering in summer. Twice daily during heat waves over 90°F.

## Common Mistakes

- **Watering on a fixed schedule regardless of weather.** A week of cool, cloudy weather? Skip a watering. A heat wave? Add one. Pay attention to your plants, not your calendar.
- **Shallow, frequent watering.** This trains roots to stay near the surface, making plants more vulnerable to heat and drought. Water deeply and less often.
- **Ignoring wind.** A 20 mph wind day can double your garden's water loss. Plan extra irrigation after windy days.
- **Not mulching.** In the Mountain West, an unmulched garden is a thirsty garden. Period.
- **Assuming rainwater collection is legal.** Check your state's current regulations before installing rain barrels.

# Chapter 4: Planning Your Mountain West Garden

You have one season. One. That season might be 80 days or 180 days, but either way, every week matters. Poor planning in April means an empty garden in August. Good planning means you're eating fresh tomatoes while your neighbors are still wondering why their transplants died.

## Step 1: Know Your Frost Dates (Really Know Them)

Go back to the table in Chapter 1. Find your sub-region. Now refine it:

- **Are you in a valley bottom?** Cold air sinks. Valley floors can be 5–10°F colder than hillsides on clear, calm nights. Your frost dates are later in spring and earlier in fall than the regional average.
- **Are you on a slope?** South-facing slopes warm earlier and hold heat longer. North-facing slopes are colder. An exposed ridgetop gets more wind but less frost pooling.
- **Are you in town or rural?** Urban heat islands can add 1–2 weeks to your season compared to rural areas at the same elevation.
- **Do you have structures or fences?** South-facing walls radiate stored heat at night, creating warm microclimates. This is why that tomato planted against your garage does better than the one in the middle of the yard.

## Step 2: Count Your Frost-Free Days

Subtract your average last spring frost date from your average first fall frost date. That's your season. Now subtract 10 days as a safety margin — because "average" means it's later than that half the time.

**Example:** Last frost May 15, first frost September 25 = 133 days. Minus 10 = 123 effective growing days.

Every vegetable you choose needs to mature within that window. If a tomato variety says "80 days to maturity" on the packet, add 10–15% for altitude. That's really 88–92 days. Does it fit in your 123-day window? Yes, but only if you transplant on time.

## Step 3: Choose the Right Crops for Your Season

Here's a quick guide to match crops with season length:

**Short season (80–110 frost-free days):**
Lettuce, spinach, radishes, peas, kale, Swiss chard, turnips, beets, carrots, potatoes, beans (bush), broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kohlrabi

**Medium season (110–140 frost-free days):**
All of the above, plus: tomatoes (short-season varieties), peppers (short-season), summer squash, zucchini, cucumbers, onions, garlic, herbs

**Long season (140–180 frost-free days):**
All of the above, plus: winter squash, melons, sweet corn, full-season tomatoes and peppers, eggplant, sweet potatoes (in warmest microclimates)

## Step 4: Map Your Garden

Before you buy a single seed, sketch your garden space. Note:

- **Sun exposure:** Vegetables need 6–8 hours of direct sun minimum. In the Mountain West, morning sun is gentler than afternoon sun. If you have partial shade, give it to lettuce and greens. Full sun goes to tomatoes, peppers, and squash.
- **Wind exposure:** Identify your prevailing wind direction (typically west/southwest). Plan windbreaks on that side — fences, walls, trellised crops, or dedicated windbreak plantings.
- **Water access:** How far is your garden from the hose bib or irrigation line? Run drip lines before planting.
- **Slope and drainage:** Low spots collect cold air and water. Don't plant frost-sensitive crops there. Don't plant anything that hates wet feet there either.

## Step 5: Build a Planting Calendar

This is the most important planning tool you'll create. For each crop, work backward from your first fall frost date:

**Example for "Glacier" tomato (55 days to maturity, transplanted):**
- First fall frost: September 25
- Minus 10-day safety margin: September 15
- Minus 55 days to maturity (+ 15% altitude adjustment = 63 days): July 14
- This is the LATEST you should transplant

Now work forward from your last spring frost:
- Last frost: May 15
- Earliest safe transplant for tomatoes: May 15 (or later if soil isn't warm)
- Transplant window: May 15 – July 14

Your indoor seed-starting date:
- Tomatoes need 6–8 weeks indoors before transplant
- 8 weeks before May 15 = March 20

Write this out for every crop you plan to grow. Yes, it takes an afternoon. Yes, it's worth it.

## Raised Beds vs. In-Ground

**Raised beds win in the Mountain West for several reasons:**
- You control the soil (critical with alkaline clay or rocky substrate)
- Soil warms earlier in spring (can add 1–2 weeks to your season)
- Better drainage in clay soil areas
- Easier to cover for frost protection
- Defined space for efficient drip irrigation

**Build 12–18 inches deep** for most vegetables. Use untreated cedar, galvanized steel, or concrete blocks. Avoid treated lumber — modern ACQ-treated wood is safer than old CCA-treated wood, but untreated cedar or metal eliminates the question entirely.

**Fill with:** 60% quality topsoil, 30% compost, 10% perlite or coarse sand. This mix drains well, holds nutrients, and is loose enough for root development.

**In-ground gardening works well** in Idaho's volcanic loam, Montana's river-bottom soils, and anywhere you have decent native soil. Amend with 4–6 inches of compost annually and consider permanent raised rows (bermed up 6–8 inches) to improve drainage and warming.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not planning at all.** "I'll figure it out at the nursery" leads to buying 85-day tomatoes when you have a 75-day season.
- **Overplanting.** A 4x8 raised bed can feed a family of four a shocking amount of food if planted well. Start small, succeed, and expand next year.
- **Ignoring vertical growing.** Trellised cucumbers, pole beans, and vining squash produce more per square foot than bush varieties. Use that vertical space.
- **Forgetting succession planting.** Plant lettuce every 2–3 weeks for continuous harvest instead of all at once (and then having 40 heads bolt simultaneously in June).

# Chapter 5: Season Extension — Your Secret Weapon

If Mountain West gardening has a cheat code, it's season extension. The difference between a garden with no protection and a garden with cold frames and row covers can be 6–8 extra weeks of production. In a region where your season might be 90 days, adding 6 weeks is transformative.

## Row Covers (Floating and Supported)

**Lightweight row cover (0.5–0.9 oz/sq yard):** Provides 2–4°F of frost protection while allowing 85% light and rain through. Lay directly over crops or drape over low hoops. This is your everyday frost insurance — leave it on cold-sensitive crops from transplant until nighttime temps are reliably above 50°F.

**Medium-weight row cover (1.0–1.5 oz/sq yard):** Provides 4–8°F of frost protection. Use for early spring and late fall extension. Reduces light transmission to 70%, which is fine for cool-season crops but may slow warm-season growth.

**Heavy row cover (1.5–2.0 oz/sq yard):** Provides 6–10°F of protection. Use for overwintering crops or during hard freezes. Too heavy to leave on during active growth — remove during the day.

> **Pro Tip:** Support row covers on wire hoops (9-gauge wire bent into half-circles) rather than laying directly on plants. Direct contact with frost cover can still cause freeze damage where the fabric touches leaves.

## Cold Frames

A cold frame is essentially a bottomless box with a transparent lid — a mini greenhouse that sits right on your garden bed. In the Mountain West, cold frames are transformational.

**Build or buy:** A simple cold frame can be made from a straw bale surround with an old window on top, or you can build a proper wood frame with a polycarbonate lid. Size it to fit your raised beds.

**Use cold frames to:**
- Start hardening off transplants 2–3 weeks before last frost
- Grow lettuce, spinach, and radishes 4–6 weeks before outdoor planting
- Extend fall harvest into November or December
- Overwinter garlic, spinach, and mâche for early spring harvest

**Management:** Vent cold frames on sunny days — even in winter, temperatures inside can spike above 90°F when the sun hits. Prop the lid open when daytime temps exceed 50°F. Close in late afternoon to trap heat for the night. A temperature-activated auto-vent ($25–40) eliminates the guesswork.

## Hoop Houses and High Tunnels

If you're serious about extending your season — or you're gardening above 7,000 feet and need every advantage — a hoop house is the best investment you can make.

**What it does:** A hoop house (unheated greenhouse, typically 10–30 feet wide, covered in 6-mil greenhouse plastic) creates a protected growing environment that is typically 10–20°F warmer than outside during the day and 5–10°F warmer at night. In a typical Mountain West location, this adds 4–8 weeks to each end of the season.

**Cost:** DIY hoop houses run $1–3 per square foot. Commercial high tunnels run $3–8 per square foot. The USDA NRCS offers cost-share programs (EQIP) for high tunnels — contact your local NRCS office.

**What to grow inside:** Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and melons in summer. Lettuce, spinach, kale, and Asian greens through fall and winter. Many Mountain West gardeners harvest fresh greens from unheated hoop houses from November through March.

**Ventilation is critical.** A hoop house in the Mountain West can hit 120°F on a sunny June day. Roll-up sides or end-wall vents are essential. Automate if possible.

## Wall o' Waters and Season Starters

Wall o' Water (or similar water-filled plant protectors) are a Mountain West tradition for a reason. These tubes of water surround a transplant, absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night. They provide 10–15°F of frost protection and allow you to transplant tomatoes and peppers 3–4 weeks before last frost.

**How to use them:** Set up Wall o' Waters 2–3 days before transplanting to warm the soil. Transplant into the center. Leave them on until nighttime temperatures are reliably above 45°F (usually 3–4 weeks after last frost). Then remove — they restrict airflow and can cause fungal issues if left too long.

**Cost:** About $15 for a 3-pack. Reusable for 3–5 seasons. For the cost of a few takeout meals, you're eating garden tomatoes three weeks earlier.

## Thermal Mass and Heat Sinks

**Water jugs:** Fill black-painted gallon jugs with water and place them throughout the garden. They absorb heat during the day and radiate it at night, moderating temperature swings by 2–4°F. Free if you have old milk jugs.

**Rock walls and raised beds:** Stone and concrete absorb solar radiation. A raised bed built with stone or concrete block walls acts as a heat sink, keeping soil warmer into the evening. This is why walled gardens in mountain towns have grown food for centuries.

**South-facing walls:** The single best microclimate in your yard. A south-facing house wall, fence, or structure absorbs heat all day and radiates it back at night. Plant your most heat-loving crops here. This microclimate can be equivalent to one full zone warmer.

## Common Mistakes

- **Removing frost protection too early.** That warm May week doesn't mean summer is here. Keep row covers handy through mid-June in most of the region.
- **Not venting protected structures.** An overheated cold frame or hoop house will cook your plants faster than frost will kill them.
- **Relying on Wall o' Waters alone.** They protect individual plants but don't help the rest of your garden. Use them as part of a system that includes row covers and mulch.
- **Forgetting fall extension.** Most gardeners think about extending spring but ignore fall. A few row covers in September can keep your garden producing through October — or later.

# Part II: Growing the Crops

# Chapter 6: Cool-Season Vegetables — The Mountain West Backbone

Cool-season crops are the foundation of Mountain West gardening. They handle frost, they grow in cool soil, and in short-season locations, they might be *all* you can reliably grow outdoors. But even in longer-season areas like the Wasatch Front or Boise, cool-season crops fill the critical early and late windows when warm-season plants can't survive.

## Lettuce and Salad Greens

**Days to maturity:** 30–60 days (leaf lettuce to full heads)  
**Frost tolerance:** Hardy to 28°F; survives light frost without protection  
**Soil temperature for germination:** 40–75°F (won't germinate above 80°F)

Lettuce is Mountain West gardening on easy mode. Direct sow 3–4 weeks before last frost, or start transplants indoors 4–6 weeks before last frost for earlier harvests.

**Varieties that thrive here:**
- **Leaf lettuce:** "Black Seeded Simpson" (45 days), "Red Sails" (45 days), "Salad Bowl" (50 days)
- **Romaine:** "Jericho" (60 days, heat tolerant), "Little Gem" (50 days, compact)
- **Butterhead:** "Buttercrunch" (55 days), "Tom Thumb" (48 days, container-friendly)

**The bolting problem:** Mountain West sun intensity causes lettuce to bolt (go to seed) fast once temperatures exceed 75°F. Solutions:
- Succession plant every 2–3 weeks through spring
- Use shade cloth (30–40%) in June and July
- Plant heat-tolerant varieties like "Jericho" and "Muir"
- Resume planting 8 weeks before first fall frost — fall lettuce is often better than spring lettuce

> **Pro Tip:** Lettuce in a cold frame can produce from March through December in most of the Mountain West. It's the single best cold-frame crop.

## Spinach

**Days to maturity:** 37–50 days  
**Frost tolerance:** Hardy to 20°F with minimal damage  
**Soil temperature for germination:** 35–75°F

Spinach is tougher than lettuce and handles Mountain West conditions beautifully — except summer. It bolts even faster than lettuce when days get long and hot.

**Varieties:** "Bloomsdale Long Standing" (48 days, classic), "Space" (40 days, smooth leaf, easy to clean), "Tyee" (45 days, bolt-resistant)

**Strategy:** Direct sow as soon as soil can be worked in spring — spinach germinates in soil as cool as 35°F. Get two plantings in before bolting forces you to stop, then resume 8–10 weeks before first fall frost. Fall-planted spinach can overwinter under mulch or row cover and produce very early the following spring.

## Peas

**Days to maturity:** 55–70 days  
**Frost tolerance:** Hardy to 25°F (plants); seeds germinate in 45°F soil  
**Types:** Shelling peas, snap peas, snow peas

Peas love cool weather and can go in the ground 4–6 weeks before last frost. They need a trellis (even "bush" varieties produce better with support), and they need to mature before summer heat arrives.

**Varieties:**
- **Snap:** "Sugar Snap" (62 days), "Super Sugar Snap" (65 days)
- **Snow:** "Oregon Sugar Pod" (60 days), "Mammoth Melting Sugar" (68 days)
- **Shelling:** "Green Arrow" (68 days), "Knight" (56 days, early)

**Mountain West tip:** Inoculate seeds with rhizobium bacteria before planting. Peas fix nitrogen from the air, but only if the right bacteria are present in the soil. A $5 packet of inoculant dramatically improves yields, especially in new garden beds.

> **Pro Tip:** In longer-season areas, plant a second round of peas in late July or early August for a fall harvest. Peas planted in declining heat often taste sweeter than spring peas.

## Broccoli, Cauliflower, and Cabbage

**Days to maturity:** 50–85 days from transplant  
**Frost tolerance:** Hardy to 25°F (mature plants)  
**Soil temperature for transplanting:** 40°F minimum

The brassica family thrives in cool weather, and the Mountain West's cool nights and intense sun produce incredibly dense, flavorful heads. Start transplants indoors 6–8 weeks before last frost. Transplant 2–4 weeks before last frost under row covers.

**Broccoli varieties:** "Waltham 29" (74 days, cold-hardy classic), "De Cicco" (65 days, produces side shoots for extended harvest), "Arcadia" (63 days, cold-tolerant hybrid)

**Cauliflower varieties:** "Snow Crown" (50 days, reliable), "Graffiti" (80 days, purple, doesn't need blanching), "Amazing" (68 days)

**Cabbage varieties:** "Early Jersey Wakefield" (63 days, pointed heads), "Copenhagen Market" (72 days, round heads), "Red Express" (63 days, compact red)

**Timing is everything:** These crops need to head up before temperatures consistently exceed 80°F, or they'll bolt, button (form tiny heads), or just sulk. In short-season areas, start transplants early and protect them. In longer-season areas (Boise, Wasatch Front), you can also grow a fall crop — start transplants indoors in June and transplant in July.

## Kale and Swiss Chard

**Days to maturity:** 50–65 days  
**Frost tolerance:** Kale survives to 10°F; chard to 25°F  

These are the Mountain West's most reliable greens. Plant once, harvest for months. Both handle frost, heat, and altitude with minimal complaint.

**Kale varieties:** "Lacinato" aka Dinosaur kale (60 days, best flavor), "Red Russian" (50 days, tender), "Winterbor" (60 days, extremely cold-hardy)

**Swiss chard varieties:** "Bright Lights" (55 days, colorful), "Fordhook Giant" (60 days, big leaves), "Peppermint" (60 days, striking)

**Growing tips:** Direct sow or transplant after last frost. Harvest outer leaves continuously, leaving the center to keep producing. Kale actually tastes better after frost — cold converts starches to sugars. In mild-winter areas, kale can survive through winter under row cover and produce into the following spring.

## Root Vegetables: Carrots, Beets, Turnips, and Radishes

These are short-season heroes. They grow in cool soil, handle frost, and store well.

### Carrots

**Days to maturity:** 55–80 days  
**Varieties:** "Nantes" types (65 days, sweet, cylindrical) are best for Mountain West soils — they handle rocky soil better than long, tapered types. "Danvers Half Long" (75 days) for heavier soil. "Little Finger" (55 days) and "Thumbelina" (60 days, round) for containers and shallow beds.

**Key tip:** Carrot seeds are slow to germinate (10–21 days). Keep the seedbed consistently moist during germination — in our dry air, this means watering lightly twice daily. Cover with burlap or row cover to retain moisture until sprouts appear.

### Beets

**Days to maturity:** 50–65 days  
**Varieties:** "Detroit Dark Red" (58 days, classic), "Chioggia" (55 days, candy-striped), "Golden" (55 days, doesn't stain)

**Mountain West advantage:** Cool nights and intense sun produce exceptionally sweet beets. Direct sow 2–4 weeks before last frost. Succession plant every 3 weeks through midsummer for continuous harvest. Both roots and greens are edible — don't waste those tops.

### Turnips

**Days to maturity:** 35–60 days  
**Varieties:** "Hakurei" (38 days, sweet Japanese salad turnip — a revelation if you only know the bitter purple-topped kind), "Purple Top White Globe" (55 days, storage)

### Radishes

**Days to maturity:** 22–35 days (spring types); 50–70 days (winter/daikon types)  
**Varieties:** "Cherry Belle" (22 days), "French Breakfast" (25 days), "Watermelon Radish" (60 days, stunning)

Radishes are the fastest crop you can grow. Direct sow as soon as soil can be worked. Succession plant every 10 days for steady supply. They bolt fast in heat, so focus radish plantings in spring and fall.

## Potatoes

**Days to maturity:** 70–120 days depending on type  
**Frost tolerance:** Tops killed by frost; tubers survive underground  

Potatoes are a Mountain West staple and one of the most satisfying crops to grow. Plant seed potatoes 2–4 weeks before last frost, 4 inches deep. Hill soil or mulch around stems as they grow — exposed tubers turn green and toxic.

**Varieties:**
- **Early (70–90 days):** "Yukon Gold," "Red Norland," "Caribe" — essential for short-season areas
- **Mid (90–110 days):** "Kennebec," "All Blue," "French Fingerling"
- **Late (110–120 days):** "Russet Burbank" (the classic Idaho baker) — only for 130+ day seasons

**Mountain West tips:**
- Cut seed potatoes into pieces with 2–3 eyes each. Let cut surfaces dry (callus) for 1–2 days before planting.
- Don't plant in soil where potatoes, tomatoes, or peppers grew last year (disease rotation).
- Colorado potato beetle is the number one pest. Hand-pick adults and crush orange egg masses on leaf undersides. Spinosad spray for heavy infestations.
- Harvest "new potatoes" anytime after flowering by carefully digging around plants. Harvest main crop after tops die back.

> **Pro Tip:** Potatoes in straw bales or deep-mulch systems work brilliantly in the Mountain West. Plant seed potatoes on top of native soil, cover with 12 inches of straw, and keep adding straw as plants grow. Harvest by pulling back the straw — no digging required. Yields are slightly lower but harvest is effortless.

## Onions and Garlic

### Onions

**Days to maturity:** 90–120 days from transplant  
**Critical detail:** Onions are day-length sensitive. The Mountain West is in the **long-day** onion zone. Plant ONLY long-day varieties. Short-day onions (for the South) will form tiny bulbs. Intermediate-day varieties work in southern Utah and southern Colorado.

**Varieties:** "Walla Walla" (sweet, doesn't store well), "Copra" (excellent storage), "Yellow Sweet Spanish" (large, sweet), "Redwing" (red, good storage)

**How to grow:** Start from seeds indoors 10–12 weeks before last frost, or buy transplants (bundles of pencil-thin seedlings). Sets (small dry bulbs) are convenient but produce smaller onions. Transplant 4–6 weeks before last frost. Onions are one of the first things in the garden.

### Garlic

**When to plant:** FALL. Plant individual cloves 4–6 weeks before the ground freezes (typically September 15–October 15 in most of the region). Garlic needs a cold period to form bulbs.

**Types:** **Hardneck** garlic is the Mountain West choice. It's cold-hardy, produces scapes (edible flower stalks — a delicacy), and develops complex flavors. Softneck garlic is for mild-winter areas and stores better, but hardneck handles our winters more reliably.

**Varieties:** "Music" (large, hot, reliable), "German Extra Hardy" (extremely cold-tolerant), "Chesnok Red" (incredible roasted), "Spanish Roja" (classic flavor)

**How to grow:** Plant cloves pointed end up, 3 inches deep, 6 inches apart. Mulch with 4–6 inches of straw after the ground freezes. In spring, remove mulch gradually as shoots appear. Cut scapes when they curl (eat them — they're amazing). Harvest when lower 1/3 of leaves are brown (usually July). Cure in a warm, dry, ventilated spot for 2–3 weeks before storage.

## Common Mistakes

- **Planting short-day or intermediate-day onions.** They'll never size up in our long-day conditions. Long-day varieties ONLY (except southern UT).
- **Planting garlic in spring.** Spring-planted garlic produces small, undivided bulbs. It needs winter's cold to develop properly. Plant in fall.
- **Crowding root crops.** Thin them to recommended spacing. Dense carrots produce only tops and skinny roots.
- **Waiting too long to plant cool-season crops.** They should be in the ground well before last frost. That's the whole point — they're cool-season.

# Chapter 7: Warm-Season Vegetables — Beating the Clock

Warm-season crops are the glamour vegetables — tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, corn. They're what most people imagine when they think about a garden. And in the Mountain West, they're the ones that require the most strategy, because you're racing against a short growing window with crops that hate cold.

The rules:
1. **Start indoors.** Most warm-season crops need 6–10 weeks of growth before transplanting.
2. **Don't transplant until soil is warm.** Air temperature lies. Soil temperature tells the truth. Tomatoes need 60°F soil minimum; peppers need 65°F.
3. **Choose short-season varieties.** This isn't negotiable in most of the region.
4. **Protect transplants.** Row covers, Wall o' Waters, or cloches for the first 2–4 weeks.

## Tomatoes

**Days to maturity:** 50–85 days from transplant (for Mountain West-appropriate varieties)  
**Soil temperature for transplanting:** 60°F minimum  
**Frost tolerance:** None. Dies at 32°F.

Tomatoes are the most popular vegetable in American gardens, and in the Mountain West, they're the most challenging warm-season crop to grow well. The good news: when you succeed, high-altitude tomatoes have an intensity of flavor that lowland gardeners envy. Cool nights, intense UV, and big day-night temperature swings concentrate sugars and acids.

### Variety Selection Is Everything

Forget "Better Boy," "Big Beef," and most grocery-store-name tomatoes. These are 75–85 day varieties bred for long, warm seasons. You need short-season varieties — and there are excellent ones.

**Determinate (compact, good for containers and short seasons):**
- "Glacier" (55 days, small red fruits, extremely early and cold-tolerant)
- "Stupice" (60 days, Czech heirloom, outstanding flavor for an early tomato)
- "Siletz" (65 days, full-sized slicer, Oregon-bred for cool conditions)
- "Legend" (68 days, disease-resistant, parthenocarpic — sets fruit without pollination in cool weather)

**Indeterminate (larger plants, keep producing until frost):**
- "Early Girl" (62 days, reliable standard)
- "Juliet" (60 days, grape-type, prolific, crack-resistant)
- "Sungold" (57 days, orange cherry, possibly the best-tasting cherry tomato on Earth)
- "Black Cherry" (65 days, complex flavor)
- "Oregon Spring" (58 days, large fruit for such an early variety)

**Paste/sauce:**
- "Glacier" (55 days, doubles as sauce tomato)
- "Principe Borghese" (75 days, Italian drying tomato — only for longer-season areas)
- "Mama Leone" (62 days, paste type bred for short seasons)

### Starting Tomatoes Indoors

Start seeds 6–8 weeks before your planned transplant date (which is your last frost date or later).

**Setup:** Seed starting mix (not garden soil), individual cells or small pots, and a grow light. A south-facing window isn't enough — seedlings will get leggy. A basic LED shop light 2–4 inches above seedlings for 14–16 hours daily produces stocky, strong transplants.

**Temperature:** Germinate at 70–80°F (use a heat mat if your house is cool). After sprouting, grow at 60–70°F days / 55–60°F nights.

**Pot up:** When seedlings have their second set of true leaves, transplant into 3–4 inch pots. Bury the stem — tomatoes root along buried stems, creating a stronger plant.

### Transplanting

**When:** After last frost, when soil temperature is 60°F or higher at 4-inch depth. Use a soil thermometer ($8–12 at any garden center). Don't trust the calendar — trust the thermometer.

**How:** Harden off transplants for 7–10 days (gradually expose them to outdoor conditions). Dig a deep hole or a trench, and bury the tomato up to its top set of leaves. This promotes a massive root system. Water with dilute fertilizer (half-strength liquid fish or kelp). Install cage, stake, or trellis at planting time — not later when you'll damage roots.

**Early protection:** Use Wall o' Waters or row covers for the first 3–4 weeks. This isn't just frost protection — it creates a warmer microclimate that accelerates early growth.

### Mountain West Tomato Problems

**Blossom drop:** When nighttime temps drop below 55°F or exceed 75°F, tomatoes drop flowers without setting fruit. Our cool nights sometimes cause spring blossom drop. Be patient — fruit set improves as nights warm.

**Sunscald:** White or papery patches on fruit facing the sun. Our intense UV makes this common. Don't over-prune — leaf canopy protects fruit. If sunscald is severe, drape shade cloth (30%) over plants in July.

**Cracking:** Dramatic moisture swings (dry spell followed by heavy watering or rain) cause skin cracking. Maintain consistent moisture with drip irrigation and mulch.

**Early blight:** Less common in the dry Mountain West than in the humid East, but it can appear. Brown spots with concentric rings on lower leaves. Remove affected leaves, mulch to prevent soil splash, and space plants for airflow.

> **Pro Tip:** In a 90-day season, every tomato you harvest before frost is a victory. When frost threatens in September, pick ALL tomatoes — green ones included. Green tomatoes ripen on a countertop (don't put them in the sun — that causes decay, not ripening). Wrap individually in newspaper and store in a single layer at 55–65°F. They'll ripen over 2–6 weeks.

## Peppers

**Days to maturity:** 55–80 days from transplant  
**Soil temperature for transplanting:** 65°F minimum  
**Frost tolerance:** None. Damaged below 40°F.

Peppers are even more heat-demanding than tomatoes, but the Mountain West's intense sun is a secret advantage. Hot peppers develop more capsaicin at altitude, and sweet peppers concentrate sugars in the cool nights.

**Varieties:**
- **Sweet:** "Ace" (60 days, reliable green-to-red), "Carmen" (60 days, Italian frying type, early), "King of the North" (68 days, large bell, bred for cool climates), "Lunchbox" (60 days, snack peppers)
- **Hot:** "Early Jalapeño" (65 days), "Hungarian Hot Wax" (60 days), "Joe's Long Cayenne" (65 days), "Serrano Tampiqueno" (75 days — longer season only)

**Growing tips:**
- Start indoors 8–10 weeks before last frost (peppers are slow starters)
- Transplant 1–2 weeks AFTER tomatoes when soil is genuinely warm
- Black plastic mulch warms soil and boosts pepper production 20–30%
- Don't over-fertilize with nitrogen — you'll get big plants with few peppers
- Pick first fruits early to encourage more production

## Summer Squash and Zucchini

**Days to maturity:** 45–55 days from direct seeding  
**Soil temperature for planting:** 60°F  
**Frost tolerance:** None

Summer squash is one of the easiest warm-season crops in the Mountain West. It matures fast enough for even short-season locations, and its main problem is *too much* production (you will try to give zucchini to your neighbors; they will start avoiding you by August).

**Varieties:** "Black Beauty" zucchini (50 days), "Costata Romanesco" (52 days, ribbed Italian, best flavor), "Yellow Crookneck" (48 days), "Pattypan" (50 days)

**Growing tips:**
- Direct seed or transplant after last frost
- Give each plant 4 square feet minimum — they sprawl
- Harvest young and often (6–8 inches for zucchini). Oversized squash are watery and seedy
- **Squash vine borer** is the nemesis. Watch for entry holes at the base of stems with orange frass. Prevention: wrap base of stems with aluminum foil, or inject Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) into stems at first sign of damage
- **Powdery mildew** appears by late summer. Ensure good airflow, avoid overhead watering. Neem oil or potassium bicarbonate sprays slow the spread. Or just pull plants once production declines — you've probably had enough zucchini by then.

## Cucumbers

**Days to maturity:** 50–70 days  
**Soil temperature for planting:** 60°F  
**Frost tolerance:** None

**Varieties:** "Marketmore 76" (67 days, classic slicer), "Muncher" (60 days, burpless), "National Pickling" (52 days), "Spacemaster" (56 days, compact for containers)

**Growing tips:**
- Trellis cucumbers vertically. Better airflow, cleaner fruit, less disease, more efficient use of space.
- In short-season areas, start indoors 3–4 weeks before last frost in peat pots (cucumbers hate root disturbance)
- Consistent water is critical — drought stress causes bitter cucumbers
- Harvest frequently to keep plants producing

## Winter Squash and Pumpkins

**Days to maturity:** 80–120 days  
**Soil temperature for planting:** 65°F  

Winter squash requires a long, warm season — which makes it challenging in much of the Mountain West. But it's not impossible.

**Short-season varieties (your best bets):**
- "Delicata" (80 days, reliable, excellent flavor)
- "Acorn" (80–85 days)
- "Sweet Dumpling" (90 days)
- "Baby Pam" pumpkin (90 days)
- "Buttercup" aka "Burgess" (85 days)
- "Waltham Butternut" (95 days — pushing it in shorter seasons)

**Strategy:** Start transplants indoors 3–4 weeks before last frost. Transplant into black plastic mulch over pre-warmed soil. Use row covers for the first 3 weeks to trap heat. Each plant needs 20–40 square feet of sprawl space (or grow vertically on a strong trellis with slings supporting heavy fruit).

**Curing and storage:** After harvest (before hard frost), cure winter squash in a warm (80°F), dry spot for 10–14 days. This hardens the skin and improves flavor. Store in a cool (50–55°F), dry location. Properly cured butternut and acorn squash store for 3–6 months.

## Beans

**Days to maturity:** 50–65 days (bush); 60–75 days (pole)  
**Soil temperature for planting:** 60°F  
**Frost tolerance:** None

Beans are foolproof in the Mountain West — fast, productive, and they fix nitrogen for the next crop. Direct seed only (they don't transplant well). Plant after last frost when soil is warm.

**Bush beans (best for short seasons):** "Provider" (50 days, one of the earliest), "Contender" (55 days, disease-resistant), "Dragon Tongue" (55 days, beautiful purple-streaked pods), "Royal Burgundy" (55 days, purple pods turn green when cooked)

**Pole beans (need 60+ days and a trellis):** "Fortex" (60 days, French filet type, incredible fresh eating), "Kentucky Wonder" (65 days, classic), "Scarlet Runner" (70 days, ornamental and edible, hummingbird magnet)

**Dry beans:** "Black Turtle" (85 days), "Pinto" (90 days), "Cannellini" (80 days). Only for longer-season areas (140+ frost-free days) unless you're willing to pull plants and finish drying indoors.

## Sweet Corn

**Days to maturity:** 60–90 days  
**Soil temperature for planting:** 60°F (65°F for supersweet types)  

Sweet corn is possible in medium-to-long-season areas of the Mountain West. It's a heavy feeder, a heavy drinker, and requires space — but there's nothing like eating corn you picked five minutes ago.

**Short-season varieties:** "Earlivee" (63 days), "Sugar Buns" (72 days), "Bodacious" (75 days), "Trinity" (68 days)

**Growing tips:**
- Plant in blocks (minimum 4 rows), not single rows — corn is wind-pollinated and needs neighbors
- Space 12 inches apart in rows 30 inches apart
- Side-dress with nitrogen when plants are knee-high
- Each stalk produces 1–2 ears. Plan accordingly — a family of four wants at least 40–60 plants for a meaningful harvest
- Raccoons will eat your corn the night before you planned to harvest it. Chicken wire cages around ears, or an electric fence, are the only reliable deterrents.

## Common Mistakes

- **Transplanting warm-season crops too early.** A cold-stressed pepper plant may survive a 40°F night, but it won't grow for two weeks afterward. You gain nothing by planting early into cold soil.
- **Choosing wrong varieties.** That gorgeous heirloom tomato that takes 85 days? It needs 98 days at your altitude. Do the math.
- **Neglecting soil temperature.** Buy a soil thermometer. Use it. $10 saves you a season of frustration.
- **Under-supporting plants.** A 5-foot tomato cage from the hardware store is not enough for a vigorous indeterminate tomato. Use 6-foot stakes, heavy-duty cages, or the Florida weave string trellis system.

# Chapter 8: Herbs for the Mountain West

Herbs are some of the easiest and most rewarding crops in the Mountain West. Many Mediterranean herbs — the ones you use most in cooking — evolved in conditions remarkably similar to ours: sunny, dry, alkaline soil, intense UV. Your garden is basically the Mediterranean at altitude.

## Herbs That Love It Here

### Basil
**Annual.** Start indoors 6 weeks before last frost. Transplant after last frost into warm soil. Pinch flowers to prolong harvest. "Genovese" for classic pesto, "Thai" for Asian cooking, "Mrs. Burns Lemon" for something different and delicious.

### Cilantro
**Annual (bolts fast).** Direct sow every 2–3 weeks starting 2 weeks before last frost. It will bolt to seed (coriander) in summer heat — let some go to seed and collect the coriander. "Slow Bolt" and "Santo" varieties extend harvest by a few weeks. Fall plantings often do better than spring.

### Dill
**Annual.** Direct sow after last frost. "Bouquet" for seed heads (pickles), "Fernleaf" for sustained leaf production. Self-seeds enthusiastically — once you grow dill, you'll always have dill.

### Parsley
**Biennial (treat as annual).** Start indoors 8–10 weeks before last frost (notoriously slow to germinate — soak seeds overnight). Italian flat-leaf has better flavor; curly is easier to grow. Hardy through light frosts.

### Mint
**Perennial (Zones 3–8). AGGRESSIVE SPREADER.** Plant in containers unless you want it to colonize your entire garden. Spearmint, peppermint, and chocolate mint all thrive. Virtually indestructible once established.

### Oregano
**Perennial (Zones 4–9).** Plant once, harvest for years. Greek oregano has the best culinary flavor. Loves dry, alkaline soil — basically perfect Mountain West conditions. Full sun, excellent drainage.

### Thyme
**Perennial (Zones 4–8).** Another Mediterranean herb perfectly suited to our conditions. "Common" thyme for cooking, "Lemon" thyme for variety. Excellent drainage is essential — it will rot in wet clay.

### Sage
**Perennial (Zones 4–8).** Grows into a beautiful woody shrub. Drought-tolerant once established. "Berggarten" has large, flavorful leaves. Practically maintenance-free in well-drained soil.

### Rosemary
**Perennial in Zones 7+; annual or container plant elsewhere.** Rosemary is marginal in most of the Mountain West. It survives winter in protected microclimates along the Wasatch Front, southern Colorado, and southern Utah. Everywhere else, grow in containers and bring indoors for winter. "Arp" is the hardiest variety (rated to Zone 6 in ideal conditions — south-facing wall with excellent drainage).

### Chives
**Perennial (Zones 3–9).** Completely bulletproof. Grows anywhere, survives everything, comes back every spring with no help. Lovely purple flowers are edible. One of the first things to emerge in spring.

> **Pro Tip:** Perennial herbs (oregano, thyme, sage, chives) are ideal for that dry, rocky, slightly neglected corner of the yard that's too harsh for vegetables. They thrive on benign neglect — overwatering and over-fertilizing actually reduce flavor.

## Common Mistakes

- **Overwatering Mediterranean herbs.** Oregano, thyme, sage, and rosemary want dry conditions. Wet roots kill them faster than cold.
- **Planting mint in the ground.** It will escape and take over. Container only.
- **Not pinching basil.** Pinch off flower buds the moment they appear. Once basil blooms, leaf production drops and flavor declines.

# Chapter 9: Perennial Vegetables and Permanent Plantings

Perennial vegetables are the "plant once, harvest for years" category, and in a region where the growing season is short and labor is concentrated, perennials are worth their weight in gold.

## Asparagus

**Zones:** 3–8 (thrives throughout the Mountain West)  
**Years to first harvest:** 2–3 years from crowns  
**Productive life:** 20+ years

Asparagus is a long-term commitment — like a garden mortgage. It takes 2–3 years to establish, but once it's producing, a well-maintained bed feeds you every spring for two decades or more.

**Varieties:** "Jersey Knight" and "Jersey Giant" (all-male hybrids, more productive, no volunteer seedlings), "Mary Washington" (open-pollinated classic, slightly lower yields)

**How to plant:** Dig a trench 8–10 inches deep, 18 inches wide. Amend the bottom with compost and a cup of bone meal per 10 feet. Set crowns 18 inches apart, spreading roots over a small mound in the trench bottom. Cover with 3 inches of soil. As shoots appear, gradually fill the trench over the first season.

**Harvest:** Don't harvest the first year. Harvest lightly (2–3 weeks) the second year. Full harvest (6–8 weeks) starting year three. Stop harvesting when new spears are thinner than a pencil — let the fern grow to recharge the roots.

**Mountain West tip:** Asparagus loves our well-drained, alkaline soil. Beds mulched with 4 inches of straw overwinter beautifully. Biggest threat: late frost damage to early spears. Cover beds with row fabric when frost threatens in spring.

## Rhubarb

**Zones:** 2–8 (the Mountain West is peak rhubarb territory)  
**Years to first harvest:** 1–2 years from divisions  
**Productive life:** 10–20 years

If any perennial vegetable was designed for the Mountain West, it's rhubarb. It needs cold winters (below 40°F for 8+ weeks), struggles in heat, and is virtually indestructible in Zones 3–6. Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and mountain Colorado grow spectacular rhubarb.

**Varieties:** "Victoria" (green stalks with pink base, reliable from seed), "Valentine" (deep red, sweeter), "Canada Red" (intensely red, needs division less frequently)

**How to plant:** Plant divisions (not seeds — too slow) in spring, 3 feet apart, in rich soil with excellent drainage. Set the crown bud just at soil level. Water well the first year. Mulch in fall.

**Harvest:** Don't harvest the first year. Light harvest the second year. Full harvest starting year three — pull (don't cut) stalks by grasping near the base and twisting. Stop harvesting by mid-June to let plants recharge. NEVER eat the leaves — they contain toxic levels of oxalic acid.

## Horseradish

**Zones:** 3–9  
**Productive life:** Indefinite (the problem is stopping it)

Plant a root cutting in spring, 2–3 inches deep, at a 45-degree angle. Harvest roots in late fall after a few frosts (cold improves flavor). Warning: horseradish is unkillable and will spread aggressively. Plant it in a contained area or a buried pot.

## Common Mistakes

- **Harvesting asparagus too soon or too long.** Patience in years 1–2 builds the root system for decades of production.
- **Planting perennials in prime annual vegetable space.** Perennials need their own dedicated area — they're permanent, and you can't rototill around them.
- **Ignoring rhubarb because "it's just for pies."** Rhubarb sauce, rhubarb chutney, rhubarb jam, and strawberry-rhubarb anything are all exceptional. It's the most productive perennial you'll grow.

# Part III: Managing the Mountain West Garden

# Chapter 10: Month-by-Month Growing Calendar

This calendar is for the "median" Mountain West garden — roughly Zone 5, 5,000–6,000 feet elevation, with 120–140 frost-free days. Adjust earlier for warmer zones (Boise, Wasatch Front, Front Range south) and later for colder zones (Montana, Wyoming, mountain towns). In short-season areas above 7,000 feet, compress everything by 2–4 weeks.

## January–February: Planning and Ordering

- **Order seeds** from catalogs that specialize in short-season varieties. Recommended sources: Territorial Seed (Oregon-based, excellent for our region), High Mowing Seeds (Vermont, cold-climate focus), Snake River Seed Cooperative (Boise, specifically Mountain West), Seed Savers Exchange (heirloom varieties)
- **Clean and organize** seed-starting supplies. Replace old grow light bulbs.
- **Test soil** if you didn't in fall.
- **Build or repair** raised beds, trellises, and cold frames.
- **Review last year's notes.** What worked? What failed? Adjust your plan.

## March: Indoor Seed Starting Begins

**Start indoors (first two weeks):**
- Onions and leeks (if not already started in February)
- Peppers and eggplant

**Start indoors (second half):**
- Tomatoes (6–8 weeks before last frost)
- Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage

**Outside:**
- Prune fruit trees and berry bushes before bud break
- In longer-season areas (Zones 6b–7a), direct sow peas and spinach in late March if soil is workable
- Turn compost pile, if it's thawed

## April: Hardening Off and First Outdoor Plantings

**Start indoors:**
- Cucumbers, squash, melons (3–4 weeks before transplant date)
- Additional succession of broccoli and lettuce

**Outside (as soon as soil is workable):**
- Direct sow: peas, spinach, lettuce, radishes, carrots, beets, turnips, kale, Swiss chard, onion sets
- Transplant hardened-off broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower under row covers
- Set up Wall o' Waters for tomatoes in warmer microclimates (2–3 weeks before last frost)
- Plant seed potatoes
- Plant asparagus and rhubarb crowns

**Maintenance:**
- Prepare warm-season beds with black plastic mulch to pre-warm soil
- Install drip irrigation

## May: The Main Event

**After last frost (mid to late May for most areas):**
- Transplant tomatoes, peppers, eggplant
- Direct sow or transplant summer squash, zucchini, cucumbers, beans
- Direct sow corn (warm-soil areas only)
- Continue successive sowings of lettuce, radishes, beets, carrots

**Protection:**
- Keep row covers handy — late frosts are common through May
- Monitor overnight lows. Cover tender transplants any night below 40°F.

**Maintenance:**
- Thin direct-seeded crops to proper spacing
- Begin regular watering schedule
- Side-dress brassicas with nitrogen when they start forming heads

## June: Growth Explosion

Everything planted in May begins growing aggressively as days lengthen and soil warms.

**Planting:**
- Last succession sowings of bush beans and corn
- Sow fall broccoli and cauliflower starts indoors (for transplant in July)
- Continue lettuce successions using heat-tolerant varieties
- Plant winter squash transplants (if not already done)

**Maintenance:**
- Mulch everything once soil is warm (60°F+)
- Stake and cage tomatoes before they need it
- Begin harvesting peas, radishes, lettuce, and spinach
- Watch for and hand-pick Colorado potato beetles
- Cut asparagus harvest by mid-June; let ferns grow
- Cut garlic scapes when they curl

## July: Peak Season

**Harvesting:** Lettuce, spinach, peas (finishing), radishes, beets, beans, zucchini, summer squash, early tomatoes, cucumbers, herbs

**Planting:**
- Sow fall crops for direct seeding in late July / early August: beets, carrots, turnips, kale, lettuce, spinach, radishes
- Transplant fall broccoli and cauliflower

**Maintenance:**
- Water consistently — this is the hottest, driest month
- Side-dress tomatoes and peppers with balanced fertilizer
- Prune tomato suckers for airflow and to direct energy to fruit
- Monitor for spider mites (tiny speckling on leaves, fine webbing) — spray with water or insecticidal soap
- Harvest garlic when lower leaves brown
- Begin curing onions as tops fall over

## August: Transition Month

**Harvesting:** Tomatoes, peppers, corn, beans, squash, cucumbers, melons, potatoes (early varieties), onions, garlic

**Planting:**
- Last sowings of fall lettuce, spinach, and radishes
- Plant garlic cover crops or fall cover crops in empty beds
- In longer-season areas, plant a final round of bush beans

**Maintenance:**
- Continue consistent watering
- Watch for powdery mildew on squash — remove affected leaves
- Begin watching overnight lows. In mountain towns, frost can hit by late August
- Prepare frost covers and row fabric

## September: Race to the Finish

**Harvesting:** Everything. Harvest intensively before frost.

**Frost management:**
- Cover frost-sensitive crops (tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, cucumbers) on any night forecast below 35°F
- Pick mature peppers and tomatoes (including green ones) before the first hard frost
- Hardy crops (kale, broccoli, carrots, beets, Brussels sprouts) improve with light frost — leave them

**Planting:**
- Plant garlic (mid-September through mid-October)
- Sow cover crops (winter rye, hairy vetch) in empty beds
- In cold frames: sow lettuce, spinach, and mâche for fall/winter harvest

**Maintenance:**
- Cure winter squash and pumpkins indoors (80°F, dry, 10 days)
- Dig potatoes after tops die back. Cure in dark, cool spot for 2 weeks
- Save seeds from open-pollinated varieties

## October: Putting the Garden to Bed

**Harvesting:** Root crops (carrots, beets, turnips — can stay in ground under mulch until hard freeze), kale, Brussels sprouts, cold frame greens

**Cleanup:**
- Remove dead annual plants and diseased material (don't compost diseased plants — trash them)
- Till or broadfork empty beds (or cover with mulch for no-till approach)
- Empty and store drip irrigation lines and soaker hoses (freeze damage will crack them)
- Drain and store hoses

**Preparation:**
- Mulch garlic beds with 4–6 inches of straw after ground freezes
- Mulch perennial vegetables (asparagus, rhubarb) with 4–6 inches of straw
- Note what worked and what failed. Write it down. You WILL forget by March.

## November–December: Rest and Plan

- Harvest cold frame greens
- Browse seed catalogs
- Review notes and plan next year's garden
- Maintain and repair tools
- Dream. Order that one extra seed packet you don't really need but absolutely must try. That's gardening.

## Common Mistakes

- **Missing the indoor seed-starting window.** Mark your calendar in January. If you forget to start tomatoes indoors, you're buying transplants at the nursery — which is fine, but limits your variety choices.
- **Not planting fall crops.** The July/August planting window for fall crops is easy to miss when you're busy harvesting. Set calendar reminders.
- **Leaving drip irrigation out to freeze.** One night below 20°F and your drip system is cracked. Drain and store.

# Chapter 11: Pests and Diseases

The Mountain West has fewer pest problems than humid regions — our dry air discourages most fungal diseases, and many insect pests are less abundant at altitude. But we have our own rogues' gallery, and some of them are formidable.

## Insect Pests

### Colorado Potato Beetle
The only insect pest named after one of our states, and it earned the honor. Adults are yellow-orange with black stripes; larvae are red-orange with black spots. Both devour potato, tomato, eggplant, and pepper leaves.

**Control:** Hand-pick adults and crush bright orange egg masses on leaf undersides (check daily in June). Mulch heavily — beetles emerge from soil. Spinosad spray for heavy infestations. Rotate nightshade crops (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers) annually. Neem oil on larvae works as a deterrent. Note: this beetle has developed resistance to many synthetic insecticides.

### Aphids
Tiny green, black, or red clusters on new growth and leaf undersides. They suck sap, distort growth, and transmit viruses.

**Control:** A strong spray of water knocks off most aphids. Ladybugs and lacewings are natural predators — avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that kill these beneficials. Insecticidal soap for heavy infestations. Reflective mulch (silver plastic) confuses aphids and reduces colonization.

### Squash Bug
Gray-brown shield-shaped adults cluster at the base of squash and pumpkin plants. They suck sap and can wilt entire plants. Eggs are copper-colored, laid in neat rows on leaf undersides.

**Control:** Hand-pick adults (they're sluggish in morning). Crush egg clusters. Place boards near plants — bugs hide under them at night, making morning collection easy. Remove and destroy plant debris in fall (overwintering site). Kaolin clay spray deters egg-laying.

### Squash Vine Borer
A moth that lays eggs at the base of squash stems. Larvae bore into stems, causing sudden wilting. You'll see a hole with orange sawdust-like frass.

**Control:** Wrap stem bases with aluminum foil from soil level up 4 inches. Row cover until flowering (then remove for pollination). If you find damage, slit the stem lengthwise with a razor, remove the larva, and bury the damaged section in soil to root. Butternut squash is resistant.

### Flea Beetles
Tiny black beetles that chew shothole patterns in leaves of brassicas, eggplant, and potatoes. Worst on seedlings.

**Control:** Row cover over seedlings until plants are established. Kaolin clay spray. Heavy mulching reduces beetle emergence from soil.

### Spider Mites
Almost invisible but devastating in hot, dry conditions — which describes our summers perfectly. Look for fine stippling on leaves and tiny webs.

**Control:** Regular strong water sprays (upper and lower leaf surfaces) prevent buildup. Avoid dusty conditions near the garden. Predatory mites (available from insectary suppliers) provide biological control. Insecticidal soap or neem oil for outbreaks.

### Tomato Hornworm
Enormous (3–4 inch) green caterpillar that can strip a tomato plant in days. Beautiful to look at; devastating to your garden.

**Control:** Hand-pick (they're easy to spot despite their camouflage). If you see a hornworm covered in white rice-like projections, leave it — those are parasitic wasp cocoons that will produce more wasps to control future hornworms. Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) spray is effective on young larvae.

## Diseases

### Powdery Mildew
White powdery coating on squash, cucumber, and melon leaves. Appears in late summer when days are warm and nights are cool (sound familiar?).

**Control:** Plant resistant varieties. Space for airflow. Avoid overhead watering. Potassium bicarbonate spray (1 tablespoon per gallon of water plus a few drops of dish soap). Neem oil. Remove badly affected leaves.

### Curly Top Virus
Transmitted by beet leafhoppers. Causes stunting, leaf curling, and yellowing in tomatoes, peppers, and beans. Common in the arid West.

**Control:** No cure. Remove infected plants. Row cover prevents leafhopper access. "Roza" and some other tomato varieties show tolerance. Reflective mulch deters leafhoppers.

### Verticillium and Fusarium Wilt
Soilborne fungi that cause yellowing and wilting, typically starting on one side of the plant. Common in tomatoes and peppers.

**Control:** Plant resistant varieties (look for "V" and "F" designations). Rotate crops — don't plant nightshades in the same spot for 3–4 years. Solarize soil (cover with clear plastic for 4–6 weeks in summer).

### Late Blight
The disease that caused the Irish Potato Famine. Less common in the dry Mountain West, but can appear in wet years. Water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruit; white mold growth in humid conditions.

**Control:** Don't water overhead. Space plants for airflow. Copper fungicide as preventive in unusually wet seasons. Destroy infected plants immediately (don't compost).

## Organic Pest Management Philosophy

The Mountain West's climate is naturally hostile to many pests and diseases. Work with this advantage:

1. **Keep it dry.** Drip irrigation, good spacing, and mulch reduce most fungal diseases.
2. **Encourage beneficial insects.** Plant flowers (especially members of the carrot and daisy families) near your garden. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides.
3. **Rotate crops.** Never plant the same family in the same spot two years in a row.
4. **Inspect regularly.** A 5-minute walk through the garden every morning catches problems early, when they're manageable.
5. **Accept imperfection.** A few holes in leaves don't affect yield. Not every bug is a pest. Healthy soil grows healthy plants that resist problems naturally.

## Common Mistakes

- **Spraying at the first sign of any insect.** Most garden insects are beneficial or neutral. Identify the pest before treating.
- **Using broad-spectrum insecticides that kill beneficials.** One application of carbaryl (Sevin) wipes out the ladybug population that was controlling your aphids for free.
- **Overwatering, which creates disease.** In the Mountain West, most disease comes from too much moisture, not too little.
- **Not rotating crops.** Planting tomatoes in the same bed year after year guarantees soilborne disease buildup.

# Chapter 12: Wildlife Management

In most of the country, deer are the gardener's main wildlife problem. In the Mountain West, deer are just the opening act. You're also dealing with elk, moose (in some areas), rabbits, voles, ground squirrels, pocket gophers, bears, raccoons, and enough grasshoppers in some years to darken the sky.

This isn't optional reading. If you garden in the Mountain West without a wildlife strategy, you're feeding the local fauna, not your family.

## Deer and Elk

A single deer eats 6–8 pounds of vegetation daily. An elk eats 20 pounds. They will find your garden. They will jump a 4-foot fence without slowing down.

**Fencing is the only reliable solution.** Deer can jump 8 feet, but they're reluctant to jump into an enclosed space they can't see the far side of. Options:

- **8-foot fence:** The gold standard. Can be post-and-wire with welded wire fencing. Not pretty, but effective.
- **Double fence:** Two 4-foot fences spaced 5 feet apart. Deer won't jump the width. Cheaper and easier to build than 8-foot.
- **Electric fence:** 3–4 strands at 12, 24, 36, and 48 inches. Bait with peanut butter on aluminum foil strips (deer lick the foil, get shocked, learn). Effective but requires maintenance and a power source (solar chargers work well).

**Repellents:** Commercial deer repellents (Bobbex, Liquid Fence, Plantskydd) work temporarily. Reapply after rain or irrigation. They reduce browsing but don't prevent it. Not a substitute for fencing in high-pressure areas.

## Rabbits

Cottontails and jackrabbits chew young plants at or near ground level. They can eat an entire row of bean seedlings in one night.

**Control:** 2-foot chicken wire fence buried 3–4 inches underground around the garden perimeter. This is cheap, easy, and completely effective. Individual wire cloches over high-value transplants during establishment.

## Voles and Pocket Gophers

Voles (field mice) eat roots, bulbs, and the base of plants. They travel in tunnels through mulch and ground cover. Pocket gophers are larger and tunnel through soil, eating roots and leaving mounds.

**Vole control:** Pull mulch 6 inches back from plant stems. Snap traps in runways (peanut butter bait). Keep grass mowed around garden edges — voles avoid exposed areas.

**Gopher control:** Hardware cloth (1/2-inch mesh) lining the bottom of raised beds is the most reliable prevention. Gopher baskets (wire mesh cages) around individual plants. Traps in active tunnels (Macabee-style traps are effective but check local regulations).

## Ground Squirrels and Prairie Dogs

They dig, they eat plants and seeds, and their burrows undermine garden beds. Exclusion is the primary strategy: hardware cloth buried at bed bottoms, and fencing that extends underground.

## Bears

If you live in bear country (mountain Colorado, Montana, parts of Idaho and Wyoming), bears may be attracted to compost piles, fruit trees, and — in rare cases — vegetable gardens.

**Prevention:** Bear-proof compost bins (or keep compost in a secure location). Pick ripe fruit promptly. Don't store pet food or trash near the garden. In active bear areas, electric fencing around the garden doubles as bear and deer deterrence.

## Grasshoppers

In outbreak years on the eastern plains and lower elevations, grasshoppers can be apocalyptic. Clouds of them strip every green thing in sight.

**Control:** Nosema locustae (a natural pathogen sold as "Semaspore") is the best biological control — apply to surrounding areas in spring when hoppers are young. Kaolin clay on plants deters feeding. Row covers protect individual crops. Chickens and guinea fowl eat massive quantities. In severe outbreaks, nothing fully works. Plant extra and accept losses.

## Common Mistakes

- **Thinking repellents will stop hungry deer.** In a hard winter or drought, hungry animals push through every repellent. Fencing is the answer.
- **Forgetting underground threats.** Gophers and voles attack from below. If your raised beds don't have hardware cloth bottoms, you're vulnerable.
- **Leaving the garden unfenced "to see if it's a problem."** It will be a problem. One night of deer damage can cost you an entire season's crop.

# Chapter 13: Fertilizing for Mountain West Conditions

The Mountain West's alkaline soils, low organic matter, and short growing season create specific fertilization challenges. You can't just follow the instructions on a bag of generic fertilizer and expect good results.

## What Mountain West Soils Typically Need

Based on your soil test (you got one, right? Chapter 2?), here's what most Mountain West gardens need:

**Nitrogen (N):** Almost always deficient. Our soils are low in organic matter, which is the primary natural source of nitrogen. You'll need to supplement.

**Phosphorus (P):** Often adequate or even high in Mountain West soils. Don't add more unless your soil test says you need it — excess phosphorus causes water quality problems and locks up other nutrients.

**Potassium (K):** Usually adequate. Again, let the soil test guide you.

**Iron, zinc, and manganese:** These are the micronutrients most likely to be deficient — not because they aren't in the soil, but because alkaline pH locks them up. At pH 8.0, iron is practically unavailable to plants, even if there's plenty in the soil.

## Fertilizer Strategies

### Organic Approach

**Compost** is your foundation — 2–4 inches annually provides slow-release nutrition and improves soil biology. Supplement with:

- **Blood meal** (12-0-0): Fast-acting nitrogen source. Apply 2–3 lbs per 100 square feet at planting, side-dress heavy feeders (corn, brassicas) at midseason.
- **Bone meal** (3-15-0): Phosphorus source for root development. Mix into planting holes for transplants. Only add if soil test shows deficiency.
- **Kelp meal** (1-0-2 plus micronutrients): Excellent source of potassium and trace minerals. 1–2 lbs per 100 square feet at planting.
- **Fish emulsion** (5-1-1): Liquid fertilizer for midseason boosts. Dilute and apply every 2–3 weeks during active growth. Yes, it smells terrible. Your plants don't care.
- **Chelated iron** (EDDHA form): Foliar spray or soil drench for iron chlorosis. The EDDHA chelate works in alkaline soils; cheaper EDTA chelates don't.

### Conventional Approach

A balanced granular fertilizer (10-10-10 or 16-16-16) applied at planting provides a baseline. Side-dress heavy feeders with nitrogen (ammonium sulfate, 21-0-0, which also helps acidify slightly) at midseason. Apply chelated micronutrients as needed.

### When to Fertilize

**At planting:** Work compost and dry amendments into the top 6 inches of soil.

**Side-dress at midseason:** When tomatoes start setting fruit, corn is knee-high, or brassicas begin forming heads, apply additional nitrogen alongside rows.

**Foliar feeding:** Liquid kelp or fish emulsion sprayed on leaves (early morning or evening to avoid leaf burn) provides a quick nutritional boost. Chelated iron is most effective as a foliar spray.

**Stop fertilizing 3–4 weeks before first frost.** Late-season fertilization encourages soft new growth that's vulnerable to freeze damage.

> **Pro Tip:** Sulfur (granular or pelletized) applied around acid-loving crops like blueberries can locally lower pH. But for vegetable beds, it's more practical to work around the alkalinity with chelated micronutrients than to try to change the pH.

## Common Mistakes

- **Over-fertilizing with nitrogen.** Produces lush green foliage at the expense of fruit. Tomato and pepper plants that are all leaves and no fruit are usually over-fertilized.
- **Adding phosphorus when it's not needed.** Most Mountain West soils have adequate phosphorus. Adding more wastes money and pollutes.
- **Ignoring micronutrient deficiency.** Yellow leaves with green veins (interveinal chlorosis) on tomatoes, peppers, and beans usually means iron deficiency — not nitrogen deficiency. Nitrogen-deficient leaves yellow evenly.
- **Using non-chelated iron supplements.** In alkaline soil, non-chelated iron becomes unavailable within hours. Use EDDHA-chelated iron only.

# Chapter 14: Composting at Altitude

Making compost in the Mountain West is both essential and frustrating. You need compost desperately — your soil is begging for organic matter. But the conditions that make composting easy elsewhere (warmth, humidity, consistent moisture) are exactly what we lack.

## Why Mountain West Composting Is Slow

- **Low humidity** dries piles quickly. Material on the surface turns into hay, not compost.
- **Cold temperatures** slow microbial activity. Your pile may be frozen for 4–5 months of the year.
- **UV intensity** degrades materials on the surface.
- **Dry air** means you need to water your compost pile — which feels absurd but is necessary.

## Making It Work

**Enclosed systems win.** Tumbler composters, enclosed bin systems, or three-bin systems with lids retain moisture and heat far better than open piles. In the Mountain West, an open pile is basically a dry-goods storage facility.

**Water your compost.** Seriously. The ideal moisture level is "wrung-out sponge." In our climate, this means adding water every time you add material, and occasionally soaking the pile during dry stretches. If it's dry, it's not composting.

**Size matters.** A pile smaller than 3×3×3 feet won't generate enough heat to compost effectively. Go bigger if you can — 4×4×4 is ideal.

**Location:** Full sun in a sheltered spot. Winter sun warms the pile; shelter reduces moisture loss from wind. Near a water source for convenience.

**Balance carbon and nitrogen.** Browns (dry leaves, straw, cardboard) to greens (kitchen scraps, fresh grass, garden waste) at roughly 3:1 by volume. In practice, most people add too many browns. More greens = more heat = faster composting.

**Chop or shred materials.** Smaller pieces decompose faster. Run fallen leaves over with a lawnmower before adding them.

**Realistic timeline:** In the Mountain West, expect 6–12 months for finished compost (vs. 3–6 months in warmer, humid climates). Hot composting methods (actively managed, turned regularly, proper C:N ratio) can produce compost in 3–4 months during the warm season.

> **Pro Tip:** Vermicomposting (worm composting) indoors is an excellent alternative for Mountain West gardeners. A worm bin under the kitchen sink or in the garage produces rich castings year-round, regardless of outdoor conditions. Red wigglers process kitchen scraps into black gold with minimal effort.

## Common Mistakes

- **Letting the pile dry out.** Dry compost = not compost. Water it.
- **Turning too infrequently.** Turn every 2–3 weeks during the active season to introduce oxygen and redistribute moisture.
- **Adding meat, dairy, or cooked food to outdoor piles.** Attracts wildlife — a real problem in bear and raccoon country.
- **Expecting fast results.** Patience. Mountain West composting is slower. Supplement with purchased compost while your pile works.

---

# Chapter 15: Container Gardening at Altitude

Containers are the equalizer. Bad soil? Doesn't matter — you control the mix. Short season? Containers warm faster than ground. No yard? A sunny patio or balcony works. Containers also solve the deer problem, the gopher problem, and the "my HOA won't let me have a garden" problem.

## Container Basics for the Mountain West

**Size matters more here.** Small containers dry out impossibly fast in our low humidity and wind. Minimums:
- Herbs: 3–5 gallon
- Lettuce and greens: 5 gallon
- Peppers: 5–7 gallon
- Tomatoes: 10–15 gallon (bigger is always better)
- Squash and cucumbers: 15–20 gallon

**Material considerations:**
- **Fabric pots (smart pots):** Excellent drainage and air pruning of roots. Dry out faster than solid pots — plan on daily watering.
- **Plastic pots:** Retain moisture better. Can overheat in direct sun — use light colors.
- **Ceramic and clay:** Heavy (wind-resistant), but clay is porous and dries quickly.
- **Self-watering containers:** The best option for Mountain West container gardening. Built-in water reservoir reduces watering frequency from daily to every 2–3 days.

**Soil mix:** Never use garden soil in containers — it compacts and drains poorly. Use a quality potting mix. For large containers, mix your own: 40% peat or coco coir, 30% perlite, 20% compost, 10% vermiculite. Add slow-release fertilizer at planting.

**Watering:** Containers need water daily in summer — sometimes twice daily in hot, windy weather. Drip irrigation on a timer is the best solution. A single missed watering day in July can set a container tomato back by two weeks.

**Fertilizing:** Container plants need regular fertilization because frequent watering leaches nutrients. Liquid fertilizer (fish emulsion, liquid kelp, or balanced synthetic) every 1–2 weeks, or slow-release granular at planting supplemented with monthly liquid feeds.

## Wind Protection

Wind is the container gardener's biggest challenge in the Mountain West. A 50 mph gust can topple a 10-gallon pot and destroy a tomato plant. Solutions:

- Cluster containers together for mutual wind protection
- Place against south- or west-facing walls
- Use heavy containers (concrete, large ceramic)
- Weight lightweight containers with rocks in the bottom
- Build a simple wind screen from lattice or shade cloth on a frame

> **Pro Tip:** Five-gallon buckets from the hardware store ($3–4 each) make excellent containers. Drill 4–6 drainage holes in the bottom. They're cheap, durable, and light enough to move but heavy enough (when filled) to resist moderate wind.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using pots that are too small.** A tomato in a 3-gallon pot will survive but never thrive. Go bigger.
- **Forgetting to fertilize.** Container plants exhaust their nutrients within weeks. Feed regularly.
- **Black containers in full sun.** Soil temperature in a black pot on a sunny patio can exceed 120°F — root-killing territory. Use light-colored containers or shade pot sides.

## Asparagus

**Zones:** 3–8  
**Years to first harvest:** 2–3 from crowns  
**Productive life:** 20+ years  
**Spacing:** 18 inches in row, rows 4 feet apart  
**Sun:** Full sun  
**Water:** 1 inch/week during growing season  

**Varieties:** "Jersey Knight" (all-male, productive), "Jersey Giant" (all-male, cold-hardy), "Mary Washington" (open-pollinated)

**Harvest:** Skip year 1. Light harvest year 2 (2–3 weeks). Full harvest year 3+ (6–8 weeks). Stop when spears thinner than a pencil.

**Mountain West tips:**
- Loves alkaline, well-drained soil — perfect for our conditions
- Mulch crowns with 4 inches of straw over winter
- Late spring frosts can damage emerging spears — cover when frost threatens
- Beds improve with age — invest in good soil prep upfront

---

## Rhubarb

**Mountain West tips:**
- Thrives here like nowhere else — cold winters and cool springs are exactly what rhubarb wants
- Virtually pest and disease free in our climate
- Divide clumps every 5–8 years in early spring
- Freeze surplus: chop, bag, freeze. Ready for pies year-round.

---

## Horseradish

**Zones:** 3–9

# Chapter 19: Specialty and Underrated Crops

These crops don't always make the standard gardening lists, but they're exceptionally well-suited to Mountain West conditions.

## Kohlrabi

**Days to maturity:** 45–60 days  
**Direct sow or transplant:** Around last frost  
**Spacing:** 6 inches  

A brassica that forms an above-ground "bulb" (actually a swollen stem). Tastes like a mild, sweet broccoli stem. Raw or cooked. "Winner" (45 days) and "Kolibri" (55 days, purple) are excellent. Fast enough for the shortest seasons. Kids love it — it looks like a Sputnik from space.

## Tomatillos

**Days to maturity:** 65–80 days from transplant  
**Start indoors:** 6–8 weeks before last frost  

Easier to grow than tomatoes at altitude. More cold-tolerant, more productive, and virtually pest-free. Plant at least two for cross-pollination. "Toma Verde" (60 days) and "Purple" (70 days). Essential for salsa verde.

> **Pro Tip:** Tomatillos are a Mountain West secret weapon. They produce prolifically in conditions where tomatoes struggle, and a bed of tomatillos in a 90-day season will give you more green salsa than you know what to do with.

## Ground Cherries (Husk Cherries)

**Days to maturity:** 65–75 days from transplant  
**Start indoors:** 6–8 weeks before last frost  

Related to tomatillos. Small, sweet, golden fruits in papery husks. Taste like a tropical pineapple-tomato hybrid. "Aunt Molly's" (65 days) is the standard variety. Prolific, and fruits keep for weeks in their husks at room temperature. Self-seeding — they'll come back volunteer in future years.

## Asian Greens

**Days to maturity:** 30–60 days  
**Direct sow:** Spring and fall windows  

Bok choy, tatsoi, mizuna, and mustard greens are fast-growing, cold-tolerant, and delicious. They fill the same niche as lettuce and spinach but bring different flavors. "Mei Qing Choi" baby bok choy (40 days) and "Tatsoi" (45 days) are outstanding. Bolt-prone in heat — focus on spring and fall.

## Parsnips

**Days to maturity:** 100–120 days  
**Direct sow:** Early spring, as soon as soil is workable  

Parsnips need a long season but reward patience with sweet, nutty roots that improve dramatically after fall frosts. "Harris Model" (120 days) is the standard. Slow to germinate (14–28 days) — mark the row with radishes and keep moist. Roots can overwinter in the ground under heavy mulch and be harvested in early spring — among the sweetest vegetables you'll ever eat.

## Dry Beans and Grain

For gardeners with space and 130+ frost-free days, dry beans (pinto, black, kidney) and grain (wheat, barley, oats) are realistic. A 10×20 foot plot of dry beans can produce 10–15 lbs — a meaningful portion of a family's annual legume needs. Grow, dry on the vine, thresh (a pillowcase and a stick work fine), winnow, store.

## Brussels Sprouts

**Days to maturity:** 90–110 days from transplant  
**Start indoors:** March (for fall harvest)  
**Transplant:** Late May / early June  
**Spacing:** 24 inches  

Brussels sprouts are the ultimate fall Mountain West crop. They need a long season but actually require cool weather to form tight, sweet sprouts — which means our late-summer-to-frost window is perfect. Start indoors in March, transplant in late May/early June, and harvest after several hard frosts in October and November. Frost dramatically improves flavor by converting starches to sugars.

**Varieties:** "Long Island Improved" (90 days, compact), "Jade Cross" (95 days, disease-resistant), "Diablo" (110 days, large sprouts, sweet)

**Mountain West tips:**
- Harvest from the bottom of the stalk upward as sprouts reach 1–1.5 inches
- Remove lower leaves as you harvest to redirect energy upward
- Plants survive temperatures into the low 20s — one of the last crops standing in fall
- Top the plant (remove growing tip) 4 weeks before expected harvest to force uniform sprout sizing
- Can be left in the garden under snow in milder areas and harvested as needed

## Celery and Celeriac

**Days to maturity:** 80–120 days from transplant  
**Start indoors:** 10–12 weeks before last frost  
**Transplant:** After last frost  
**Spacing:** 8–10 inches  

Celery is challenging but possible in the Mountain West's cooler zones. It demands consistent moisture, rich soil, and cool temperatures — basically everything our hot, dry summers are not. But if you have a shaded spot with drip irrigation, or a hoop house with shade cloth, it's worth trying.

**Celeriac** (celery root) is the easier option for our climate. Same family, same flavor, but it forms a knobby root instead of tall stalks and is far more forgiving of our conditions. "Brilliant" (110 days) is the standard variety. Harvest after frost, and store like turnips for months.

**Mountain West tip:** If you grow celery, accept it won't look like grocery store celery — it'll be darker, thinner-stalked, and exponentially more flavorful. Blanch stalks by wrapping with newspaper or cardboard the last 2–3 weeks for milder flavor.

## Sunflowers (Edible Seeds)

**Days to maturity:** 80–100 days  
**Direct sow:** After last frost  
**Spacing:** 18–24 inches  

Not technically a vegetable, but edible sunflowers deserve a spot in the Mountain West garden. They're drought-tolerant, they attract pollinators, they provide windbreak for shorter crops, and a row of 8-foot sunflowers is genuinely beautiful against a mountain backdrop. "Mammoth Russian" (100 days) for traditional seed heads. "Royal Hybrid" (90 days) for heavy seed production.

**Harvest:** When the back of the head turns brown and seeds are plump. Cut the head, hang upside-down in a paper bag to dry, then rub out seeds. Roast with salt for the best snack you'll grow all year. Or let the birds have some — they've earned it.

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring tomatillos and ground cherries.** These produce more reliably than tomatoes in short-season areas. Don't overlook them.
- **Not trying Asian greens.** If you like stir-fry, you should be growing bok choy and tatsoi. They're as easy as lettuce.
- **Giving up on parsnips.** They take forever to germinate and forever to mature, but the flavor after frost is absolutely worth the wait.
- **Skipping Brussels sprouts.** They're one of the best fall crops for this region — and home-grown, frost-kissed sprouts taste nothing like the frozen pucks from your childhood.

# Chapter 20: Food Preservation and Storage

Growing food in a single short season means you need to think about preservation from the start. A Mountain West garden can — and should — feed you year-round, not just from June through September.

## Root Cellaring

If you have a cool, dark space (basement corner, crawl space, detached garage in cold months), you can store root vegetables for months.

**Ideal conditions:** 32–40°F, 90–95% humidity  
**Crops that store well:** Potatoes (3–6 months), carrots (4–6 months in damp sand), beets (3–4 months in damp sand), turnips/rutabagas (3–4 months), winter squash (3–6 months at 50–55°F), onions (6–12 months in dry, cool area), garlic (6–8 months in dry, cool area), cabbage (3–4 months), apples (2–6 months)

**Mountain West advantage:** Our cold, dry winters make root cellaring easier than in warm or humid climates. A well-insulated corner of an unheated garage works for much of the winter.

## Canning

Water bath canning works for high-acid foods: tomatoes (with added acid), pickles, jams, salsas, fermented foods.

**Altitude adjustment for canning:** At altitude, water boils at lower temperatures. This means you need to increase processing time.

| Elevation | Additional Time |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1,001–3,000 ft | +5 minutes |
| 3,001–6,000 ft | +10 minutes |
| 6,001–8,000 ft | +15 minutes |
| 8,001–10,000 ft | +20 minutes |

**Pressure canning** is required for low-acid foods (green beans, corn, plain tomato sauce, soups). At altitude, increase the pressure:

| Elevation | Dial Gauge | Weighted Gauge |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 0–1,000 ft | 11 psi | 10 psi |
| 1,001–2,000 ft | 11 psi | 15 psi |
| 2,001–4,000 ft | 12 psi | 15 psi |
| 4,001–6,000 ft | 13 psi | 15 psi |
| 6,001–8,000 ft | 14 psi | 15 psi |
| 8,001+ ft | 15 psi | 15 psi |

> **Pro Tip:** ALWAYS adjust for altitude when canning. Standard recipes assume sea level. Under-processed food at altitude can harbor botulism. Use tested recipes from the USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning or your Extension office.

## Freezing

The simplest preservation method. Blanch vegetables (brief boiling followed by ice bath) before freezing to preserve color, texture, and nutrition.

**Best crops for freezing:** Green beans, corn (cut off cob), peas, broccoli, peppers (no blanching needed), tomatoes (freeze whole on a sheet pan, then bag), herbs (freeze in olive oil in ice cube trays), rhubarb (chop and bag), zucchini (shredded for bread/muffins)

## Dehydrating

Mountain West conditions are actually ideal for dehydrating — low humidity means faster, more effective drying. A food dehydrator works well, but solar drying is also effective in our sunny, dry climate.

**Best crops for drying:** Tomatoes (halved, 8–12 hours), peppers (whole or sliced), herbs (all types), beans (dry on vine), onions (sliced thin), jerky (meat, but that's another book)

## Fermentation

Sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, and fermented hot sauce are excellent ways to preserve garden surplus while adding probiotics and flavor.

**Basic sauerkraut:** Shred cabbage, mix with 2% salt by weight, pack into a jar, submerge under brine, wait 1–4 weeks at room temperature. That's it. A head of cabbage becomes a months-long supply of sauerkraut with zero energy input.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not adjusting canning times and pressures for altitude.** This is a food safety issue, not a quality issue.
- **Freezing vegetables without blanching.** They'll be mushy, discolored, and nutritionally depleted within a month.
- **Not preserving at all.** A 100-day growing season can feed you for 365 days if you preserve the surplus. Don't let August tomatoes rot on the vine because you're overwhelmed — freeze them whole and deal with them later.

# Chapter 21: Hail, Wind, and Extreme Weather

The Mountain West throws weather at you that most gardening books don't bother discussing. We need to.

## Hail

Colorado's Front Range is the hailiest region in North America. Denver averages 7–9 hail events per year, many during peak growing season (June–August). A single hailstorm can shred leaves, crack stems, and destroy a month's worth of growth in ten minutes.

**Hail protection strategies:**

- **Hail netting:** Commercial hail netting (anti-hail mesh, 1/4-inch opening) draped over hoops or a simple frame is the most reliable protection. It blocks hail while allowing light, rain, and airflow. Cost: $0.15–0.50 per square foot. Worth every penny on the Front Range.
- **Row cover over hoops:** Heavy-weight row cover (1.5 oz) can deflect small hail and reduce damage from larger stones. Not foolproof but better than nothing.
- **Hoop house:** The ultimate hail protection. Greenhouse plastic absorbs impacts that would destroy open-air plants.
- **Plant placement:** Grow your most vulnerable crops (tomatoes, peppers, leafy greens) near structures that provide partial overhead coverage — a pergola, covered patio extension, or even large deciduous trees that are leafed out by hail season.

**After hail damage:**
- Don't panic. Plants are more resilient than they look.
- Remove severely damaged leaves (they won't recover and invite disease)
- Leave partially damaged leaves — they're still photosynthesizing
- Water and fertilize lightly to support recovery
- Shredded plants often regrow within 2–3 weeks and still produce a crop
- If stems are cracked but not severed, splint them with tape or strips of cloth

## Wind

Wyoming averages 12–15 mph wind speeds statewide. Parts of Colorado, Montana, and Utah are similarly exposed. Sustained wind above 15 mph:
- Increases evapotranspiration dramatically
- Physically damages leaves and stems
- Topples tall plants
- Sandblasts young seedlings (especially on sandy or gravelly soil)
- Reduces pollination efficiency (bees don't fly well in high wind)

**Windbreak strategies:**

- **Solid fences:** A 6-foot solid fence reduces wind speed for a distance of 10–15 times the fence height on the leeward side. But solid barriers create turbulence — a 50% permeable barrier (slat fence, hedge) actually protects a larger area more evenly.
- **Living windbreaks:** A row of tall sunflowers, corn, or Jerusalem artichokes on the windward side of the garden provides seasonal wind protection and is productive itself.
- **Permanent windbreaks:** Evergreen hedges (juniper, arborvitae) on the west/southwest side of the garden provide year-round wind reduction. Plan for the long term — these take 3–5 years to establish but last decades.
- **Microclimate design:** Position gardens on the lee side of buildings, hills, or existing tree lines. Even a small elevation change or structure provides meaningful protection.
- **Low tunnels and row covers:** In exposed locations, growing under row cover for the first 3–4 weeks protects seedlings during their most vulnerable period.

## Late-Season Freezes and Freak Weather Events

Every Mountain West gardener has a story about the year it snowed in June, or the September night that hit 18°F with no warning. These events are uncommon but not rare.

**Preparation:**
- Monitor forecasts obsessively during transition months (May, June, September, October)
- Keep row covers, old bed sheets, and blankets accessible — not packed away in the garage
- Water soil thoroughly before a freeze night — wet soil holds heat better than dry soil
- Harvest everything ripe before a hard freeze warning
- Accept that some years, extreme weather will cost you production. That's the deal. Diversify your crops so that a single event can't wipe out everything.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not preparing for hail on the Front Range.** If you garden in the Denver-Boulder-Fort Collins corridor without hail netting, it's a matter of when, not if, you'll lose plants.
- **Ignoring wind exposure.** That open, sunny spot with no windbreak might have great sun but terrible growing conditions.
- **Pulling hail-damaged plants too soon.** Give them 2–3 weeks — many recover surprisingly well.

# Chapter 22: The Mountain West Gardener's Toolkit

These are the tools and supplies worth investing in for Mountain West gardening specifically.

## Essential Tools

- **Soil thermometer** ($8–12): More important than a calendar for planting timing
- **Row cover fabric** (0.9 oz and 1.5 oz weights): Frost protection, pest exclusion. Buy in bulk rolls — you'll use more than you think. AgriBon AG-19 (lightweight) and AG-30 (medium) are industry standards.
- **Wire hoops** (9-gauge galvanized wire): Support row covers. Buy 100 feet of wire and cut/bend to fit your beds.
- **Drip irrigation kit** ($50–150): Timer, mainline, drip tape or emitters. Saves water, time, and produces better results than any other method.
- **Wall o' Waters** (2–3 sets): Early tomato and pepper starts
- **Cold frame** (DIY or purchased): Season extension for greens and hardening off
- **Shade cloth** (30–40% shade rating): Summer lettuce production, transplant hardening
- **Broadfork or digging fork**: For working our rocky, clay soils without destroying structure
- **Soil test kit or lab submission**: Every 2–3 years

## Nice to Have

- **Hoop house or high tunnel**: The single biggest upgrade for serious Mountain West gardeners
- **Self-watering containers**: Container gardening with 75% less watering hassle
- **Seed starting setup**: LED shop light, heat mat, trays, and quality seed-starting mix
- **Soil moisture meter** ($10–15): Takes the guesswork out of watering
- **Season journal or garden notebook**: Track planting dates, varieties, successes, failures. Your future self will thank you.

# Chapter 23: Closing Thoughts — Gardening at the Top of the World

Gardening in the Mountain West is not easy. The season is short, the conditions are extreme, and the learning curve is steep. You will lose plants to late frost, hail, deer, grasshoppers, and that one random August night that dropped to 28°F. You'll plant tomatoes too early, forget to succession-plant lettuce, and discover that the variety you chose needs 30 more days than you have.

This is normal. This is gardening.

But here's what you'll also discover: vegetables grown at altitude, in thin air and intense sun, with huge day-night temperature swings and mineral-rich soil, taste extraordinary. A tomato ripened at 5,500 feet in September has a depth of flavor that grocery store produce can't approach. Carrots sweetened by October frost in a Montana garden are a different food entirely from the ones in a plastic bag at the store.

Mountain West gardening rewards persistence, punishes complacency, and teaches you to pay attention — to your soil, your weather, your plants, and your specific patch of ground. No book (including this one) can replace the knowledge you'll build by gardening in your own yard, year after year, adjusting and learning.

The Mountain West gardening community is one of the best parts of living here. Farmers' markets, seed swaps, community garden plots, Master Gardener programs, and Extension workshops connect you with people who've been figuring out these challenges for decades. They'll share seeds, advice, extra zucchini (whether you want it or not), and the hard-won wisdom that only comes from years of growing food at altitude.

A few resources worth seeking out:

- **Your county Extension office** (Colorado State, Utah State, University of Idaho, Montana State, University of Wyoming): Free soil testing, planting guides, pest identification, and Master Gardener programs. These offices are staffed by people who garden in your specific conditions. Use them.
- **Snake River Seed Cooperative** (Boise, ID): Regionally adapted seeds grown in the Mountain West, for the Mountain West.
- **High Plains Seed** (various Mountain West locations): Another source for regionally appropriate varieties.
- **Territorial Seed Company** (Cottage Grove, OR): Pacific Northwest-based but excellent for our region. Their short-season selections are outstanding.
- **Seed Savers Exchange** (Decorah, IA): Heritage and heirloom varieties, many with Mountain West origins and adaptations.

Start small. Succeed. Expand. Keep notes. Talk to your neighbors. Visit your county Extension office. Join a community garden if you have space limitations. And next spring, when you're standing in your garden eating the first snap pea of the season, warm from the sun, with the mountains in the background — you'll know exactly why you do this.

The Mountain West will test you. It will also feed you some of the best food you've ever tasted, connect you to your landscape in a way nothing else can, and give you a satisfying answer to the question every gardener eventually asks: "Can I really grow food here?"

Yes. You absolutely can.

Happy growing.
